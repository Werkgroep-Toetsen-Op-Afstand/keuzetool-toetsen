      <description>Presentations, projects or products are often suitable for assessing application skills. Although presentations and interviews often take place face-to-face, they can also be carried out online using video conferencing software such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams. This saves travel time and costs for both students and examiners.</description>

      <description>Often, you not only want to test knowledge, but its application too. This can be done in online exams, for example in the form of open-ended questions. Other options are open book exams or case study exams. Although these are less susceptible to cheating in their online form than exams with multiple choice questions alone, they are more labour-intensive. They are therefore more likely to be an option if you have help, such as a student assistant.</description>

      <description>Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice. However, their assessment can be made easier by dividing the students into groups. Peer feedback can then be implemented in a formative setting, so that students assess each other’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</description>

      <description>If both knowledge and its application need to be assessed, you can reduce the workload by using a mixture of multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions and open-ended questions. You can also use item banks or standard model answers, which only require the examiner to scan for certain terms.</description>

      <description>This form of online assessment has some clear advantages, because the answers are standardised and can be, at least partly, marked online. It also resolves the problem of illegible handwriting. Online assessment also means that the exam can be taken at any time and location. You therefore do not have to arrange a room and it costs students less in termsof time and travel expenses.</description>

      <description>As well as knowledge reproduction, this also tests oral and presentation skills. A presentation can also be used as an overview or summary of a project rather than a longer report, and requires less marking time. Another benefit is that it reduces opportunities for cheating. Although these assessment methods have traditionally taken place in a face-to-face setting, time, monetary and space considerations (for both the educational institution and the student) can mean that the assessment is done online.</description>

      <description>The assessment of presentations and oral exams can take a lot of time. Moreover, oral exams are normally taken individually, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice. However, their assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one another’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</description>

      <description>Assessing knowledge in an online exam is more susceptible to cheating. Measures therefore need to be taken to counter this. Online assessment software can provide tools for preventing cheating as much as possible. For example, the software may turn off certain functions on the computer so that students cannot open an external web page.</description>

      <guid>https://werkgroep-toetsen-op-afstand.github.io/assessment-selection-tool/en/snippets/knowledge/know_how_itembanks/</guid>
      <description>Another way to prevent cheating is to present questions in random order or to give different students different questions. Item banks can be used to produce several versions of an exam with different sets of questions. You can find more information about this in the Guide to item banks. It is easy to present questions in random order using exam software.</description>

      <description>Online proctoring can also be used. Live proctoring means that an examiner is present in the video conference to monitor students in real time, for example via a webcam or telephone. Recorded proctoring means that video recordings are made, some of which are selected at random for monitoring. Automated proctoring uses special software that automatically checks anything that is considered to be unusual, such as an unexpected movement or sound. More information on online proctoring can be found here.</description>

      <description> If the group of students is too large to be able to use lots of open-ended questions, you could use closed-ended questions with automatic marking. Examples are multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop questions or short essay questions. Note however that this makes it even more important to ensure that students cannot cheat.  </description>

      <description> It may be a good idea to make video recordings. These can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on their presentation or to discuss their assessment.  </description>

      <description>Ensure good communication with the students.  Be transparent about the online assessment process, so that students know what to expect. Let them know for example which personal details will be needed and what they will be used for, and what they need to have with them (e.g. a student card, telephone or camera). If online proctoring will be used, be clear about what the students can expect and what the rules are.</description>

      <description> Set a suitable time limit: too much time increases the risk of cheating, but too little time causes stress and reduces the validity of the exam results. See Van Berkel (1999) (in Dutch) for estimates of the time needed for different types of questions.  </description>

      <description>This assessment method is particularly suitable for this scale if the activities can be filmed as a whole from a distance, for example in the case of a theatre performance. This means that everyone is in the picture at the same time, so that the examiner does not need to go through a huge number of videos. Depending on the number of examiners, short activities can also be assessed separately online if the student makes a short recording.</description>

      <description>A student’s competence in a certain task can be assessed by observing the student while they carry out an activity. Examples could be a clinical procedure, giving a lesson, using software or performing on stage. Although such activities sometimes need be carried out at a specific location, the assessment can take place at any time and location using live conferencing or a video recording. This can be very useful if the examiner is unable to be on campus, or if this takes too much time.</description>

      <description>Some activities, such as an holding an interview or using software, may be carried out by the student at home (or at another location). Other activities, such as a theatre performance or an activity during an internship, are more difficult to assess remotely.</description>

      <description>The examiner may choose to watch the activity live, in which case video conferencing or live streaming will be used. In this case, the assessment is location independent, but not time independent. To observe an activity from different angles, several cameras will need to be set up, or someone will be required on location to walk around with a camera. It may also be a good idea to record the activity live, so that it can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner.</description>
