      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 If the assessment will also be taken by other students (e.g.Â at a different time), present the questions in random order to prevent the sharing of answers.
 Live proctoring is quite feasible in the case of individual assessments.
 In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 It may be a good idea to make video recordings. These can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on their presentation or to discuss their assessment.
 If the examiner does not know a student, ask the student to hold up their ID card or student card to show who they are.</description>
