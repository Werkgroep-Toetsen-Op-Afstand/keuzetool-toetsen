      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 If the assessment will also be taken by other students (e.g. at a different time), present the questions in random order to prevent the sharing of answers.
 Live proctoring is quite feasible in the case of individual assessments.
 In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 If the group of students is too large to be able to use lots of open-ended questions, you could use closed-ended questions with automatic marking. Examples are multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop questions or short essay questions. Note however that this makes it even more important to ensure that students cannot cheat.
 In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 Make sure that the rules and requirements for making a video recording are clear, and don’t forget the audio.
 Use a live recording if it is necessary to intervene in the activity or discuss it immediately afterwards, or if the activity needs to be done properly in one go or within a certain time. Otherwise, it is easier to make a video recording.</description>

      <description>By digital assessment, we mean assessment using a software programme that has been designed for that purpose. This can be a part of an e-learning platform such as Canvas, or a separate assessment software programme such as TestVision or Remindo. Digital assessment makes it possible to use various types of questions, from multiple choice, to drag and drop, to short essay questions. Digital assessment is suitable for assessing the following levels of cognitive learning: remembering, understanding, applying, analysing and evaluating.</description>

      <description>During an observation, a student is observed while carrying out a certain task. For example, a student may have to conduct a performance appraisal, insert a catheter, use a pipette, perform a dance, or give a lesson. An observation can take place in a real-life or a simulated setting.</description>

      <description>An oral exam is an exam in which a student answers questions orally or gives a pitch/presentation. Oral exams are suitable for assessing the following levels of cognitive learning: remembering, understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating and creating.
Oral exams are often combined with other assessment methods. Often, an online oral exam takes place following submission of a portfolio, project, product or presentation. During an online oral exam, a student may also be allowed to give a short online presentation.</description>

      <description>A portfolio is collection of documents/files that prove that a student has acquired certain skills or competences. A portfolio may therefore be made up of different assessment methods. It usually contains self-reflection assignments and is built up over a longer time, giving insight into the student’s development and self-management skills. This makes portfolios particularly suitable for formative use, although they are also often used for summative assessment.
Portfolios are often combined with an individual or group assessment interview or a criteria-based interview.</description>

      <description>In an online presentation, a student gives a presentation or pitch on a certain subject, either individually or as a group, using video conferencing software. The student may also use presentation tools, drawings, plans or models during the presentation. The presentation can be given live or can be pre-recorded, and there may be time during or after the presentation for questions. Presentations are suitable for assessing the following levels of cognitive learning: remembering, understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating and creating.</description>

      <description>With projects and products, students can apply what they have learned in an active and practical manner, and within set boundaries. This improves their understanding of the subject. Projects and products are suitable for assessing whether a student can create and apply, analyse and evaluate knowledge.
However, projects and products are less suitable for assessing whether a student has a broad knowledge base. In practice, projects and products are often combined with other types of assessment that are more suited to this, such as exams with open-ended and/or closed-ended questions.</description>

      <description>Often, you not only want to test knowledge, but its application too. This can be done in online exams, for example in the form of open-ended questions. Other options are open book exams or case study exams. Although these are less susceptible to cheating in their online form than exams with multiple choice questions alone, they are more labour-intensive. They are therefore more likely to be an option if you have help, such as a student assistant.</description>

      <description>Knowledge assessments carried out in a 1-to-1 setting are mainly presentations, oral exams or resits of exams. Taking such assessments remotely can have advantages, such as not having to arrange a room for a single student and costing the student less in terms of time and travel expenses. The risk of fraud is not very high with remote assessment in a 1-to-1 setting.</description>

      <description>A student’s competence in a certain task can be assessed by observing the student while they carry out an activity. Examples could be a clinical procedure, giving a lesson, using software or performing on stage. Although such activities sometimes need be carried out at a specific location, the assessment can take place at any time and location using live conferencing or a video recording. This can be very useful if the examiner is unable to be on campus, or if this takes too much time.</description>

      <description>Of the assessment methods that can be used at the large scale, knowledge assessment is probably the easiest to implement online. Examples are a multiple-choice exam or an exam with open-ended questions. On campus, this type of exam is often taken in a large sports hall or lecture theatre.
This form of online assessment has some clear advantages, because the answers are standardised and can be, at least partly, marked online.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 Make sure that the rules and requirements for making a video recording are clear, and don’t forget the audio.
 Use a live recording if it is necessary to intervene in the activity or discuss it immediately afterwards, or if the activity needs to be done properly in one go or within a certain time. Otherwise, it is easier to make a video recording.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 It may be a good idea to make video recordings. These can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on their presentation or to discuss their assessment.
 If the examiner does not know a student, ask the student to hold up their ID card or student card to show who they are.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice at this scale. However, the assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one another’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</description>

      <description>Some activities, such as an holding an interview or using software, may be carried out by the student at home (or at another location). Other activities, such as a theatre performance or an activity during an internship, are more difficult to assess remotely.
The examiner may choose to watch the activity live, in which case video conferencing or live streaming will be used. In this case, the assessment is location independent, but not time independent.</description>

      <description>For groups of more than 100 students, an exam with open-ended questions alone is often inefficient.
If both knowledge and its application need to be assessed, you can reduce the workload by using a mixture of multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions and open-ended questions. You can also use item banks or standard model answers, which only require the examiner to scan for certain terms.
Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, which is why this method may not seem to be an obvious choice at this scale.</description>

      <description>Assessing knowledge in an online exam is more susceptible to cheating. Measures therefore need to be taken to counter this. Online assessment software can provide tools for preventing cheating as much as possible. For example, the software may turn off certain functions on the computer so that students cannot open an external web page.
Online proctoring can also be used. Live proctoring means that an examiner is present in the video conference to monitor students in real time, for example via a webcam or telephone.</description>

      <description>Digital assessment can take place either on-campus or online. However, a decision needs to be made as to whether it can also be taken at any time. Should every student take the exam at the same time, or can they take it at different times? In the case of formative assessment, there is little objection to this. However, it does have implications for summative assessment, as the questions from previous exams may have been leaked.</description>

      <description>Online assessment interview During an online assessment interview, the examiner asks the student questions based on predetermined criteria, using video conferencing software. These could be questions about situations that show that the student has acquired certain skills and competences. The examiner may also ask follow-up questions. Often, an online assessment interview takes place following the submission of a portfolio, project/product or presentation. During an online assessment interview, the student may be allowed to give a short online presentation.</description>

      <description>As an online assessment tool, the portfolio can be used in the same way as in a ‘regular’ setting. There are three types of portfolio:
 Assessment portfolio In an assessment portfolio, the student collects examples of their work that show that they have acquired a certain skill/competence or set of skills/competences. Feedback from other students, lecturers, supervisors and external supervisors are also often included, providing the examiner with even more information.</description>

      <description>Students need different skills to give an online presentation. As well as the ability to use video conferencing software, the presentation may also need to be adapted to the online setting. A physical poster presentation really is a different activity when done online.
Advantages *Can be done live or can be pre-recorded. *Location-independent. *Can simulate a real-life professional setting.
Disadvantages *Limited reliability if there is just one examiner. *Risk of technical problems.</description>

      <description>With a project or product, a student carries out a clearly-defined assignment. Projects often result in a product such as an analysis, recommendation, design, final product or essay:
*Analysis The student analyses a situation, problem or issue, separating the main issues from the side issues and/or identifying the advantages and disadvantages. *Recommendation A recommendation is often the result of an analysis. The student collates information from various sources to come up with a recommendation and a possible solution.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 If the group of students is too large to be able to use lots of open-ended questions, you could use closed-ended questions with automatic marking. Examples are multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop questions or short essay questions. Note however that this makes it even more important to ensure that students cannot cheat.
 In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</description>

Examples are multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop questions or short essay questions. Note however that this makes it even more important to ensure that students cannot cheat.
 In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 It may be a good idea to make video recordings. These can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on their presentation or to discuss their assessment.
 If the examiner does not know a student, ask the student to hold up their ID card or student card to show who they are.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 Make sure that the rules and requirements for making a video recording are clear, and don’t forget the audio.
 Use a live recording if it is necessary to intervene in the activity or discuss it immediately afterwards, or if the activity needs to be done properly in one go or within a certain time. Otherwise, it is easier to make a video recording.</description>

      <description>Various steps are involved, depending on whether formative or summative assessment is used. Furthermore, the number of questions in an exam that cannot be marked automatically will depend on the number of students and the time available for marking.
Formative Prior to assessment Choice of assessment method: preferably the same as for summative assessment, so that students can familiarise themselves with the selected method.
Design of exam questions or educational resources: we advise doing this well before the course starts.</description>

      <description>Preparation Assessment form An assessment form is usually used when observing students. Make sure to check that all the assessment criteria can be properly assessed online; do you have all the information you need for each criterion as the observer, or will the lack of some information on the screen (e.g. a client’s reaction) make it impossible to assess certain criteria?
Number of observations and observers The main advantage of online observation is that it can take place at any time and location.</description>

      <description>Preparation Questions The questions that you ask during an online assessment interview or oral exam are no different from those that you would ask face-to-face. You can also use images such as an anatomical or technical drawing, or a model.
Anticipating technical problems The organisation does differ from a face-to-face oral exam. As well as the &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; information (about planning, procedure, equipment, expectations, assessment method), you also need to communicate the ground rules for working on the online platform.</description>

      <description>The online approach to the student portfolio does not differ very much from the ‘regular’ approach.
Beforehand The various competences must of course be described clearly and be published online. In some cases, the competences may already be described in the portfolio software.
During Various online meetings may be set up as part of the portfolio, such as an online kick-off meeting, a meeting to explain how to use the software, or coaching meetings.</description>

      <description>Preparation Assessment form If a presentation is to be given online, you may need to make some changes to the assessment form as not every criterion can be assessed online. For example, it is difficult to judge whether the student manages to hold the audience’s attention.
Anticipate technical problems Organising online presentations differs somewhat from organising presentations face-to-face. As well as the &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; information (about planning, procedure, equipment, expectations, assessment method), you also need to communicate the ground rules for working on the online platform.</description>

      <description>Preparation The preparation required for online projects and products does not differ very much from that required in ‘regular’ education. You first need to identify which learning objectives are to be achieved by the student. You then design an assignment that ensures that the students can demonstrate that they have achieved these objectives, for example in the form of products. You also set the boundaries within which the project or product must be completed.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice at this scale. However, the assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one another’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</description>

      <description>I have students write their own exam questions and let other students use them as practice material. Some of these questions can also be used in the exam.
 *Use tags to link your learning objectives to the formative and summative online exams and report the results to the students and to yourself as lecturer. See SURF publication, in Dutch. *In the case of formative assessment, emphasise that it is permitted to make mistakes, but that the students should do their best to practice.</description>

      <description>*Show the students a few examples of a recorded online observation before they have theirs (e.g. previously submitted recordings), so that they know what is expected, both in terms of content and the recording. This also allows students to compare themselves with what they see in the recording, so that they can judge whether they are ready. *You could ask the students to hand in an unsuccessful version of the activity with the recorded online observation, so that they can learn from their mistakes.</description>

      <description>*Carry out assessment interviews in groups, so that students can look at each other&amp;rsquo;s products before the interview, ask questions and provide peer feedback. The examiner can of course also ask questions and give feedback. See this brochure by Inholland (in Dutch) for more information on organising peer feedback. *Give students the opportunity to practice an assessment interview by planning an online meeting in which students can practice with each other.</description>

      <description>*Facilitate and encourage self-management in students as they build their portfolio. For example, let students set and reflect on their own learning objectives and ask them to indicate which aspects they would most like to receive feedback on. Of course, as the examiner you may also choose to provide feedback on other aspects. *Offer peer feedback. For example, let students ask each other questions about their portfolios. This not only teaches students how to provide constructive criticism and feedback, but also helps them to think about the kinds of questions that people will have about their own portfolio.</description>

      <description>*Give students the opportunity to practice an online presentation by planning an online session in which students can practice with each other. Make sure that they have a copy of the assessment form and let them give each other feedback based on the form. The students learn a lot about their own performance through peer feedback, improve their capacity for self-reflection and inspire each other. See this brochure by Inholland (in Dutch) for more information on organising peer feedback.</description>

      <description>Organise an online peer feedback session well before the submission date for the final draft version of a project/product. Using the assessment form, the students can give each other feedback on their products. This saves you time, as many common mistakes will be picked up and solved by the students.
 *Facilitate and encourage self-management in students as they work on a project. For example, have students set themselves personal goals in their project and let them reflect on these goals.</description>

      <description>Set a suitable time limit: too much time increases the risk of cheating, but too little time causes stress and reduces the validity of the exam results. See Van Berkel (1999) (in Dutch) for estimates of the time needed for different types of questions.
 Emphasize the student’s ethical responsibility not to cheat.
 Ensure good communication with the students.

      <description>To make a video recording, the student may need equipment such a good camera, a tripod and one or more microphones. The student needs access to such equipment. Institutions also have special equipment for recording certain activities such as a lesson.
 If the students need to set up the recording equipment themselves, provide them with a checklist with clear instructions to ensure that the examiner can see everything they need to.</description>

      <description>Tips voor deze toetsvorm
 Make sure that the rules and requirements for making a video recording are clear, and don’t forget the audio.
 Use a live recording if it is necessary to intervene in the activity or discuss it immediately afterwards, or if the activity needs to be done properly in one go or within a certain time. Otherwise, it is easier to make a video recording.</description>

      <description>Presentations, projects or products are often suitable for assessing application skills. Although presentations and interviews often take place face-to-face, they can also be carried out online using video conferencing software such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams. This saves travel time and costs for both students and examiners.</description>

      <description>Often, you not only want to test knowledge, but its application too. This can be done in online exams, for example in the form of open-ended questions. Other options are open book exams or case study exams. Although these are less susceptible to cheating in their online form than exams with multiple choice questions alone, they are more labour-intensive. They are therefore more likely to be an option if you have help, such as a student assistant.</description>

      <description>Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice. However, their assessment can be made easier by dividing the students into groups. Peer feedback can then be implemented in a formative setting, so that students assess each other’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</description>

      <description>If both knowledge and its application need to be assessed, you can reduce the workload by using a mixture of multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions and open-ended questions. You can also use item banks or standard model answers, which only require the examiner to scan for certain terms.</description>

      <description>This form of online assessment has some clear advantages, because the answers are standardised and can be, at least partly, marked online. It also resolves the problem of illegible handwriting. Online assessment also means that the exam can be taken at any time and location. You therefore do not have to arrange a room and it costs students less in termsof time and travel expenses.</description>

      <description>As well as knowledge reproduction, this also tests oral and presentation skills. A presentation can also be used as an overview or summary of a project rather than a longer report, and requires less marking time. Another benefit is that it reduces opportunities for cheating. Although these assessment methods have traditionally taken place in a face-to-face setting, time, monetary and space considerations (for both the educational institution and the student) can mean that the assessment is done online.</description>

      <description>The assessment of presentations and oral exams can take a lot of time. Moreover, oral exams are normally taken individually, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice. However, their assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one another’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</description>

      <description>Assessing knowledge in an online exam is more susceptible to cheating. Measures therefore need to be taken to counter this. Online assessment software can provide tools for preventing cheating as much as possible. For example, the software may turn off certain functions on the computer so that students cannot open an external web page.</description>

      <description>Another way to prevent cheating is to present questions in random order or to give different students different questions. Item banks can be used to produce several versions of an exam with different sets of questions. You can find more information about this in the Guide to item banks. It is easy to present questions in random order using exam software.</description>

      <description>Online proctoring can also be used. Live proctoring means that an examiner is present in the video conference to monitor students in real time, for example via a webcam or telephone. Recorded proctoring means that video recordings are made, some of which are selected at random for monitoring. Automated proctoring uses special software that automatically checks anything that is considered to be unusual, such as an unexpected movement or sound. More information on online proctoring can be found here.</description>

      <description>However, the assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one another’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</description>

      <description> If the group of students is too large to be able to use lots of open-ended questions, you could use closed-ended questions with automatic marking. Examples are multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop questions or short essay questions. Note however that this makes it even more important to ensure that students cannot cheat.  </description>

      <description>Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice at this scale. However, the assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one another’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</description>

      <description> It may be a good idea to make video recordings. These can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on their presentation or to discuss their assessment.  </description>

      <description>Ensure good communication with the students.  Be transparent about the online assessment process, so that students know what to expect. Let them know for example which personal details will be needed and what they will be used for, and what they need to have with them (e.g. a student card, telephone or camera). If online proctoring will be used, be clear about what the students can expect and what the rules are.</description>

      <description> Set a suitable time limit: too much time increases the risk of cheating, but too little time causes stress and reduces the validity of the exam results. See Van Berkel (1999) (in Dutch) for estimates of the time needed for different types of questions.  </description>

      <description>This assessment method is particularly suitable for this scale if the activities can be filmed as a whole from a distance, for example in the case of a theatre performance. This means that everyone is in the picture at the same time, so that the examiner does not need to go through a huge number of videos. Depending on the number of examiners, short activities can also be assessed separately online if the student makes a short recording.</description>

      <description>A student’s competence in a certain task can be assessed by observing the student while they carry out an activity. Examples could be a clinical procedure, giving a lesson, using software or performing on stage. Although such activities sometimes need be carried out at a specific location, the assessment can take place at any time and location using live conferencing or a video recording. This can be very useful if the examiner is unable to be on campus, or if this takes too much time.</description>

      <description>Some activities, such as an holding an interview or using software, may be carried out by the student at home (or at another location). Other activities, such as a theatre performance or an activity during an internship, are more difficult to assess remotely.</description>

      <description>The examiner may choose to watch the activity live, in which case video conferencing or live streaming will be used. In this case, the assessment is location independent, but not time independent. To observe an activity from different angles, several cameras will need to be set up, or someone will be required on location to walk around with a camera. It may also be a good idea to record the activity live, so that it can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner.</description>

      <description> Use a live recording if it is necessary to intervene in the activity or discuss it immediately afterwards, or if the activity needs to be done properly in one go or within a certain time. Otherwise, it is easier to make a video recording.  </description>
