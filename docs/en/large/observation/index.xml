      <description>A studentâ€™s competence in a certain task can be assessed by observing the student while they carry out an activity. Examples could be a clinical procedure, giving a lesson, using software or performing on stage. Although such activities sometimes need be carried out at a specific location, the assessment can take place at any time and location using live conferencing or a video recording. This can be very useful if the examiner is unable to be on campus, or if this takes too much time.</description>

      <description>Find out whether location- and time-independent exams are possible, and what the advantages would be.
Some activities, such as an holding an interview or using software, may be carried out by the student at home (or at another location). Other activities, such as a theatre performance or an activity during an internship, are more difficult to assess remotely.
The examiner may choose to watch the activity live, in which case video conferencing or live streaming will be used.</description>

      <description>To make a video recording, the student may need equipment such a good camera, a tripod and one or more microphones. The student needs access to such equipment. Institutions also have special equipment for recording certain activities such as a lesson.
 If the students need to set up the recording equipment themselves, provide them with a checklist with clear instructions to ensure that the examiner can see everything they need to.</description>
