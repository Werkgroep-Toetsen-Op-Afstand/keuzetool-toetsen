      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice at this scale. However, the assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one anotherâ€™s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</description>

      <description>Tips for this assessment method
 If the group of students is too large to be able to use lots of open-ended questions, you could use closed-ended questions with automatic marking. Examples are multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop questions or short essay questions. Note however that this makes it even more important to ensure that students cannot cheat.
 In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</description>
