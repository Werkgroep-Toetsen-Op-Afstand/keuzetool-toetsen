      <description>Of the assessment methods that can be used at the large scale, knowledge assessment is probably the easiest to implement online. Examples are a multiple-choice exam or an exam with open-ended questions. On campus, this type of exam is often taken in a large sports hall or lecture theatre.
This form of online assessment has some clear advantages, because the answers are standardised and can be, at least partly, marked online.</description>

      <description>Assessing knowledge in an online exam is more susceptible to cheating. Measures therefore need to be taken to counter this. Online assessment software can provide tools for preventing cheating as much as possible. For example, the software may turn off certain functions on the computer so that students cannot open an external web page.
Online proctoring can also be used. Live proctoring means that an examiner is present in the video conference to monitor students in real time, for example via a webcam or telephone.</description>

      <description>Set a suitable time limit: too much time increases the risk of cheating, but too little time causes stress and reduces the validity of the exam results. See Van Berkel (1999) (in Dutch) for estimates of the time needed for different types of questions.
 Emphasize the studentâ€™s ethical responsibility not to cheat.
 Ensure good communication with the students.
 Be transparent about the online assessment process, so that students know what to expect.</description>
