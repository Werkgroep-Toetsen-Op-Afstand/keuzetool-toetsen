By knowledge, we mean reproduction knowledge here; this can be divided into factual knowledge on the one hand and summarizing (or understanding) on the other [@van1999zicht]. When assessing factual knowledge, the question is whether the student has remembered the knowledge. An example of factual knowledge is being able to name the characteristics of a mammal. Summarizing is about whether the student has understood the subject matter. This could include, for example, explaining the operation of a combustion engine in your own words.

When working with a small(er) group of students, there are many opportunities to test their understanding of the subject matter.
