On a small scale, it is quite possible to test application skills (such as skills in working with professional software) by means of observation. On a small scale, an assessor is more often able to be present on location, in case these actions have to be performed at a specific location. If presence on location gives the assessor a better view of the student's performance, this is preferable. But assessment can also take place independently of place and time, using video conferencing or a video recording.
