<p>Projects and products are suitable for determining whether the student can apply, analyse, evaluate or create knowledge. Consider, especially with this group size, to make the assignment a group assignment. Not only does this reduce grading time, but with group assignments, students interact more with each other and can work together on a project that they could never have completed alone.</p>
