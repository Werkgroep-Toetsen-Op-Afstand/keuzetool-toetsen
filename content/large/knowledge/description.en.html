<p>Of the assessment methods that can be used at the large scale, knowledge assessment is probably the easiest to implement online. Examples are a multiple-choice exam or an exam with open-ended questions. On campus, this type of exam is often taken in a large sports hall or lecture theatre.</p>
<p>This form of online assessment has some clear advantages, because the answers are standardised and can be, at least partly, marked online. It also resolves the problem of illegible handwriting. Online assessment also means that the exam can be taken at any time and location. You therefore do not have to arrange a room and it costs students less in termsof time and travel expenses.</p>
