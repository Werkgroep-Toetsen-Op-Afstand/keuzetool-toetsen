By knowledge in this context, reproduction knowledge is meant; this can be divided into factual knowledge on the one hand and summarizing (or understanding) on the other [@van1999zicht]. With factual knowledge, the question is whether the student has remembered the knowledge. An example of factual knowledge is being able to name the characteristics of a mammal. Summarizing is about whether the student has understood the subject matter. This could include, for example, explaining the operation of a combustion engine in your own words.

Of the assessments that can be administered on a large scale, a knowledge test is probably the easiest to carry out remotely. Consider, for example, a multiple choice test or a test with open questions. On location, such a test is often taken in a large sports or lecture hall.
