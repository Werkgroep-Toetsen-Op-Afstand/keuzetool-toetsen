<ul>
<li><p>Emphasize the student’s ethical responsibility not to cheat.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure good communication with the students.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be transparent about the online assessment process, so that students know what to expect. Let them know for example which personal details will be needed and what they will be used for, and what they need to have with them (e.g. a student card, telephone or camera).</li>
<li>If online proctoring will be used, be clear about what the students can expect and what the rules are. Transparency about how the online proctoring will be implemented is essential. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.surf.nl/files/2020-04/surf-rapport-online-proctoring_2020_update-april-2020.pdf">SURF online proctoring report: Surveilleren op afstand</a>.</li>
<li>You also need to let the students know about any technical requirements. At a minimum, students will need a stable internet connection. It is important to let the students know of any specific computer hardware requirements for the assessment software and to provide alternatives if this is not available.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Not every student has suitable living conditions with a quiet room to take an exam in. Where possible, offer an alternative, such as a room on campus that students can use.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of formative assessment, use can be made of peer feedback. See <a href="https://www.inholland.nl/media/18717/inh_factsheet-peerreview_a4-nl-digitaal.pdf">this publication by Inholland for more information about the organisation of peer feedback</a>.</p></li>
