<p>A studentâ€™s competence in a certain task can be assessed by observing the student while they carry out an activity. Examples could be a clinical procedure, giving a lesson, using software or performing on stage. Although such activities sometimes need be carried out at a specific location, the assessment can take place at any time and location using live conferencing or a video recording. This can be very useful if the examiner is unable to be on campus, or if this takes too much time. A recording can also make it easier for the activity to be assessed by a second examiner or used for peer feedback.</p>
<p>This assessment method is particularly suitable for this scale if the activities can be filmed as a whole from a distance, for example in the case of a theatre performance. This means that everyone is in the picture at the same time, so that the examiner does not need to go through a huge number of videos. Depending on the number of examiners, short activities can also be assessed separately online if the student makes a short recording. However, long or complex individual activities that need to be filmed close-up and assessed in detail, such as complex clinical procedures, are often more difficult to assess remotely.</p>
