<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice at this scale. However, the assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one another’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that the rules and requirements for making a video recording are clear, and don’t forget the audio.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a live recording if it is necessary to intervene in the activity or discuss it immediately afterwards, or if the activity needs to be done properly in one go or within a certain time. Otherwise, it is easier to make a video recording.</p></li>
</ul>
