<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong>
* Use open-ended questions as much as possible, in random order.</p>
<p>*Live proctoring is quite feasible on a small scale.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice at this scale. However, the assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one another’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be a good idea to make video recordings. These can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on their presentation or to discuss their assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide the students into groups wherever possible so that they can give a group presentation, to reduce the time required for assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of formative assessment, use can be made of peer feedback.</p></li>
