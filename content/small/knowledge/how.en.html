<p>Assessing knowledge in an online exam is more susceptible to cheating. Measures therefore need to be taken to counter this. Online assessment software can provide tools for preventing cheating as much as possible. For example, the software may turn off certain functions on the computer so that students cannot open an external web page.</p>
<p>Online proctoring can also be used. Live proctoring means that an examiner is present in the video conference to monitor students in real time, for example via a webcam or telephone. Recorded proctoring means that video recordings are made, some of which are selected at random for monitoring. Automated proctoring uses special software that automatically checks anything that is considered to be unusual, such as an unexpected movement or sound. More information on online proctoring can be found <a href="https://www.surf.nl/whitepaper-online-proctoring-surveilleren-op-afstand">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another way to prevent cheating is to present questions in random order or to give different students different questions. Item banks can be used to produce several versions of an exam with different sets of questions. You can find more information about this in the <a href="https://werkgroep-toetsen-op-afstand.github.io/Handboek-Itembanken/">Guide to item banks</a>. It is easy to present questions in random order using exam software.</p>
<p>The assessment of presentations and oral exams can take a lot of time. Moreover, oral exams are normally taken individually, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice. However, their assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one anotherâ€™s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</p>
