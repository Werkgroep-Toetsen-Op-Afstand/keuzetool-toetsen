One method for assessing knowledge is a multiple-choice exam with open-ended questions.  

```{r, child="../../snippets/knowledge/know_description_advantages.en.md"}
```

There are other options for assessing knowledge at the small scale, such as an individual or group presentation or an oral exam.
