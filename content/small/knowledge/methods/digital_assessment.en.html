<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use open-ended questions as much as possible, in random order.</p></li>
<li><p>Live proctoring is quite feasible on a small scale.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</p></li>
</ul>
