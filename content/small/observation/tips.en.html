<li><p>To make a video recording, the student may need equipment such a good camera, a tripod and one or more microphones. The student needs access to such equipment. Institutions also have special equipment for recording certain activities such as a lesson.</p></li>
<li><p>If the students need to set up the recording equipment themselves, provide them with a checklist with clear instructions to ensure that the examiner can see everything they need to. Have the students set up the equipment so that nobody can walk in front of the camera.</p></li>

<p>Even in a live assessment situation, it may be a good idea to record the assessment. The recordings can be reviewed afterwards by the assessor themselves in case of doubt, or by a second assessor. It could be of educational value for the student to watch the recording themselves or together with the assessor, to reflect on the learning process or to discuss the assessment. In addition, certain software offers the possibility to add feedback to the video at relevant moments.</p>
