<p>An observation is ideally suited for the assessment of physical abilities. On a small scale, an assessor is more often able to be present on location, in case these actions have to be performed at a specific location. If presence on location gives the assessor a better view of the studentâ€™s performance, this is preferable. But assessment can also take place independently of place and time, using video conferencing or a video recording.</p>
