This online assessment method is suitable for this scale. The video recordings can be made individually or as a group. If the recordings are made individually, only one person needs to be in the picture, making it easier to make a clear video recording. If the recording is of a group, such as a theatre performance, the best way to assess the performance is by filming the group as a whole.
