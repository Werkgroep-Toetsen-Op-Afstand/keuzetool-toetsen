<p>A studentâ€™s competence in a certain task can be assessed by observing the student while they carry out an activity. Examples could be a clinical procedure, giving a lesson, using software or performing on stage. Although such activities sometimes need be carried out at a specific location, the assessment can take place at any time and location using live conferencing or a video recording. This can be very useful if the examiner is unable to be on campus, or if this takes too much time. A recording can also make it easier for the activity to be assessed by a second examiner or used for peer feedback.</p>
<p>This online assessment method is suitable for this scale. The video recordings can be made individually or as a group. If the recordings are made individually, only one person needs to be in the picture, making it easier to make a clear video recording. If the recording is of a group, such as a theatre performance, the best way to assess the performance is by filming the group as a whole.</p>
