<p>Often we do not only want to test knowledge, but also application skills and insight (analysis, synthesis and evaluation). To demonstrate application skills, students must be able to handle previously obtained information in a different situation than the one that was learned (Van Berkel, 1999, p.16); for example, think of an exercise such as ‘Calculate the standard deviation of the following number series.’ in AutoCAD or working with diagnostic software). When analyzing, students must be able to distinguish between different facts, opinions, assumptions, hypotheses or conclusions (Van Berkel, 1999, p.17); think of a test question such as ‘Explain the cause of the First World War’. Synthesis requires students to create something unique or original (Van Berkel, 1999, p.17); an example of this is the assignment to design an electric car. In evaluation, students must be able to indicate the merits of methods, ideas, persons or products in relation to a certain goal (Van Berkel, 1999, p.17); think of an assignment such as ‘Compare the Dutch and the American education system on the aspect of equality of opportunity.’</p>
