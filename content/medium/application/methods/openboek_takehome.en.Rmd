Open book and take home exams are suitable for testing higher-order cognitive skills such as applying, analysing, evaluating and creating. Particularly with take-home exams, due to the ample administration time, there is a lot of room to ask (less pre-structured) questions that appeal to higher-order cognitive skills.

Open-book and take-home exams are less susceptible to fraud than tests with only closed questions, but they are more labor-intensive to assess. With this group size, this is therefore mainly an option when there is enough manpower available to realize this, for example by deploying junior teachers.
