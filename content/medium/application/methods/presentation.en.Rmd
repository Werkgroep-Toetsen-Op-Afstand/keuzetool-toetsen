Higher cognitive skills can also be tested with a (group) presentation. A presentation offers students room for originality and creativity. In addition, presentation skills can also be tested. The opportunity that a presentation offers for interaction, for example asking questions after the presentation, offers the assessor additional opportunities to test the insight of the student. In the case of a medium-sized group of students, it is recommended, whenever possible, to divide the students into groups and have them present per group, in order to reduce assessment time.
