<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure that the rules and requirements for making a video recording are clear, and donâ€™t forget the audio.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a live recording if it is necessary to intervene in the activity or discuss it immediately afterwards, or if the activity needs to be done properly in one go or within a certain time. Otherwise, it is easier to make a video recording.</p></li>
</ul>
