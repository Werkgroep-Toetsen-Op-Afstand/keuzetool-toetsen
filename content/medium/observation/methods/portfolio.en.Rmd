A portfolio is a collection of documents/files that demonstrate that the student possesses and/or develops certain competences, and that is often built up over a longer period of time. The portfolio can therefore also include other assessment formats. For example, in an assessment portfolio, a student may include video recordings of observations and the results of their assessment as evidence of mastery of specific physical abilities. In a development portfolio, the student could also include his own reflections on this, in which it is examined which (partial) competences are insufficiently mastered and which therefore still need to be worked on.
