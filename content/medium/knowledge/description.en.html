<p>An obvious method for assessing knowledge is a multiple-choice exam with open-ended questions. On campus, this type of exam is often taken in a large sports hall or lecture theatre.</p>
<p>This form of online assessment has some clear advantages, because the answers are standardised and can be, at least partly, marked online. It also resolves the problem of illegible handwriting. Online assessment also means that the exam can be taken at any time and location. You therefore do not have to arrange a room and it costs students less in termsof time and travel expenses.</p>
<p>There are also other options for assessing knowledge at the medium scale, such as a group presentation or a group oral exam.</p>
<p>As well as knowledge reproduction, this also tests oral and presentation skills. A presentation can also be used as an overview or summary of a project rather than a longer report, and requires less marking time. Another benefit is that it reduces opportunities for cheating. Although these assessment methods have traditionally taken place in a face-to-face setting, time, monetary and space considerations (for both the educational institution and the student) can mean that the assessment is done online.</p>
