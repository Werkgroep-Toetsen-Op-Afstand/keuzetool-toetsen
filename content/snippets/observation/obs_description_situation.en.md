This assessment method is particularly suitable for this scale if the activities can be filmed as a whole from a distance, for example in the case of a theatre performance. This means that everyone is in the picture at the same time, so that the examiner does not need to go through a huge number of videos. Depending on the number of examiners, short activities can also be assessed separately online if the student makes a short recording. However, long or complex individual activities that need to be filmed close-up and assessed in detail, such as complex clinical procedures, are often more difficult to assess remotely.
