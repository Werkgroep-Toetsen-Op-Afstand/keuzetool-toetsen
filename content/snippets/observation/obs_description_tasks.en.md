A studentâ€™s competence in a certain task can be assessed by observing the student while they carry out an activity. Examples could be a clinical procedure, giving a lesson, using software or performing on stage. Although such activities sometimes need be carried out at a specific location, the assessment can take place at any time and location using a video recording. This can be very useful if the examiner is unable to be on campus, or if this takes too much time. A recording can also make it easier for the activity to be assessed by a second examiner or used for peer feedback.

If it is not possible or too time-consuming for the assessor to be present on location, the assessor can still watch live using video conferencing or live streaming. In that case, the assessment is location-independent, but not time-independent. To be able to observe actions from different angles, it is necessary to set up multiple cameras, or to have someone who is present on location walk around with a mobile device with a camera.

It is also possible to opt for an assessment that is independent of both place and time, by making a video recording that the assessor can watch at a self-chosen time. Recordings can also facilitate assessment by a second assessor or fellow student for peer feedback.
