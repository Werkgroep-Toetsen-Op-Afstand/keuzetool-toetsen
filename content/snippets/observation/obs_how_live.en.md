The examiner may choose to watch the activity live, in which case video conferencing or live streaming will be used. In this case, the assessment is location independent, but not time independent. To observe an activity from different angles, several cameras will need to be set up, or someone will be required on location to walk around with a camera. It may also be a good idea to record the activity live, so that it can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on the learning process or to discuss their assessment.
