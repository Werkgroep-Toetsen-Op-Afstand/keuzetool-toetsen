Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice. However, their assessment can be made easier by dividing the students into groups. Peer feedback can then be implemented in a formative setting, so that students assess each otherâ€™s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.
