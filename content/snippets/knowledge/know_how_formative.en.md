The assessment of presentations and oral exams can take a lot of time. Moreover, oral exams are normally taken individually, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice. However, their assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one anotherâ€™s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.
