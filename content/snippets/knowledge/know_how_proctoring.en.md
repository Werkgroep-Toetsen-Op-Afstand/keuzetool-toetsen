Online proctoring can also be used. Live proctoring means that an examiner is present in the video conference to monitor students in real time, for example via a webcam or telephone. Recorded proctoring means that video recordings are made, some of which are selected at random for monitoring. Automated proctoring uses special software that automatically checks anything that is considered to be unusual, such as an unexpected movement or sound.
