Another way to prevent cheating is to present questions in random order or to give different students different questions. Item banks can be used to produce several versions of an exam with different sets of questions. You can find more information about this in the [Guide to item banks](https://werkgroep-toetsen-op-afstand.github.io/Handboek-Itembanken/). It is easy to present questions in random order using exam software.
