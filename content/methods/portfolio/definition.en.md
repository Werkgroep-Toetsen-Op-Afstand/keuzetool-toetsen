A portfolio is a collection of documents/files that demonstrate that the student possesses and/or develops certain competences. The portfolio can therefore also include other assessment formats. In addition, a portfolio usually contains reflections of the student and is often built up over a longer period of time, with which it can provide insight into the development and self-directed learning skills of the student. This makes a portfolio very suitable for formative use. Often (part of) the portfolio is also used for summative testing.

Portfolios are often combined with an individual or group assessment interview or a criterion-based interview (CGI). This conversation offers the examiner (and fellow students) the opportunity to ask questions about matters that are still unclear, to provide feedback and/or to stimulate reflection.

Portfolios can also be used in combination with a presentation. The student then presents the most important parts/evidence from the portfolio.
