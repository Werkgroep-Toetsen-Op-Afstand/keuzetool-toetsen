A portfolio is collection of documents/files that prove that a student has acquired certain skills or competences. A portfolio may therefore be made up of different assessment methods. It usually contains self-reflection assignments and is built up over a longer time, giving insight into the studentâ€™s development and self-management skills. This makes portfolios particularly suitable for formative use, although they are also often used for summative assessment. 

Portfolios are often combined with an individual or group assessment interview or a criteria-based interview. This gives the examiner (and other students) the opportunity to ask follow-up questions about anything that is still unclear, to give feedback and/or to encourage self-reflection. 
Portfolios can also be used in combination with a presentation in which the student presents the main items of interest in the portfolio.
