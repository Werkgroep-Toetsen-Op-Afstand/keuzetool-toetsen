*Facilitate and encourage self-management in students as they build their portfolio. For example, let students set and reflect on their own learning objectives and ask them to indicate which aspects they would most like to receive feedback on. Of course, as the examiner you may also choose to provide feedback on other aspects. 
*Offer peer feedback. For example, let students ask each other questions about their portfolios. This not only teaches students how to provide constructive criticism and feedback, but also helps them to think about the kinds of questions that people will have about their own portfolio. See [this brochure by Inholland (in Dutch) for more information on organising peer feedback](https://www.inholland.nl/media/18717/inh_factsheet-peerreview_a4-nl-digitaal.pdf).
*Discuss a portfolio formatively as a group assessment. For example, have one or two (possibly more senior) students act as co-examiners and ask the student whose portfolio it is whether the feedback was useful.  
*Ask the students to also submit a self-assessment based on the assessment form as part of their portfolio, to encourage them to reflect on their own work. If you also ask them to indicate where the information relating to each assessment criterion can be found in the portfolio, you can also save yourself some marking time.
