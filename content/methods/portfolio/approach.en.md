The online approach to the student portfolio does not differ very much from the ‘regular’ approach.

## Beforehand

The various competences must of course be described clearly and be published online. In some cases, the competences may already be described in the portfolio software. 

## During

Various online meetings may be set up as part of the portfolio, such as an online kick-off meeting, a meeting to explain how to use the software, or coaching meetings.

## Afterwards 

The assessment interview that concludes the portfolio may also take place online. In some cases, this may be combined with an online presentation in which the student provides extra information about the work submitted in the portfolio.

## Points to note 

*Ensure compatibility between the portfolio, the assessment methods and the teaching activities, as this will help the students to take charge of their portfolio. 
*For students with a learning difficulty such as ADD or ADHD, it is even more important to make sure that expectations and submission deadlines are communicated clearly. We suggest that these students are set interim assignments, so that they have a clear idea of their progress.
