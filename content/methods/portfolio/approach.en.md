The online approach of the various portfolio applications hardly differs from the regular approach.

## Preparation

The various competencies must be clearly formulated in advance and made available digitally. In some cases, the competencies can already be included in the specialized portfolio software.

It is important to properly inform and guide students in compiling the portfolio, in order to prevent students who do have the competences but who are less adept at compiling a portfolio and providing evidence from becoming too low rated. Give students a global format for the portfolio, to prevent students from collecting unstructured information ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/ 79/2020/03/Tests-in-higher-education-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).

Make use of a holistic [rubric](https://husite.nl/TESTING-NEW/TEST-Cycle/construction/the-construction-van-an-assessmentform/) and train teachers for the use of this rubric, so that there is of agreement in interpretation ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger -Education-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).

Make sure that students are convinced of the usefulness of the portfolio, that they realize that they can use it both within and outside the study program to demonstrate which competences they have acquired and that it can also help them to reflect ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax -Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).

Various (online) meetings can be set up during the portfolio process. This could include an (online) kick-off, application explanation or coaching.

## Afterwards

To conclude, an assessment interview can take place (online). In some cases, this can be combined with an (online) presentation in which the candidate explains the evidence collected in the portfolio.

## Points of attention

* Make sure that the portfolio, the assessment and the educational activities are well coordinated. Students then feel more responsible for their portfolio.

* For students with a study disability such as ADD or ADHD, it is extra important to communicate clearly about expectations and deadlines. It is advisable for this target group to work with intermediate products in order to keep the work clear.
