As an online assessment tool, the portfolio can be used in the same way as in a ‘regular’ setting. There are three types of portfolio:

* **Assessment portfolio** In an assessment portfolio, the student collects examples of their work that show that they have acquired a certain skill/competence or set of skills/competences. Feedback from other students, lecturers, supervisors and external supervisors are also often included, providing the examiner with even more information. This type of portfolio is mainly used for formal assessment.
* **Development portfolio** A development portfolio contains products at various stages of their development, often with the student's reflections on their development. 
* **Showcase portfolio** In a showcase portfolio (also called a presentation portfolio), the student collects products to demonstrate the quality of their work. The student may also use this during a job interview, for example.
