As an online assessment format, the portfolio can be used in the same way as in the regular setting. The three forms are:

## Assessment portfolio

An assessment portfolio is a portfolio for summative use. In an assessment portfolio (also known as an assessment portfolio), the student collects work that demonstrates that a certain (set of) competence(s) or skills has been mastered. Feedback from fellow students, teachers, supervisors and/or external parties is often also included; this gives the assessors even richer information. This type of portfolio is mainly used for formal assessment moments.

## Development portfolio

A development portfolio is a portfolio for formative use; this consists of a collection of (partial) products in different phases of development, often supplemented with reflections. A development portfolio can be used as a tool to help learners map out the development of their knowledge, skills and attitudes and of their self-management ability.

## Showcase

In a showcase (also called a presentation portfolio or show folder), the student collects work to prove its quality. The student uses this, for example, when applying for a job.
