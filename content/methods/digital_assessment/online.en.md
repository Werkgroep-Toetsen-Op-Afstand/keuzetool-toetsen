Digital exams can be taken both on campus and online (independent of location). However, a choice that still has to be made is on whether it can also be time-independent. Do all students take the exam simultaneously, or can they do it at varying times? There are relatively few objections to this for formative assessment. However, this does have implications for summative assessment. After all, the questions from a previous administration can leak. It is advisable to have online proctoring in order for both location and time-independent summative assessment (see also [Klinkenberg, 2021](https://www.onderwijskennis.nl/sites/onderwijskennis/files/media-files/Thema%205%20-%20Sharon%20Klinkenberg.pdf)).

## Formative

When using formative assessment remotely, you could think of digital practice exams for an exam that contain all the learning objectives of the exam, or exams that question a limited learning objective, such as a digital formative test that selects random questions from a large bank of questions about a specific subject. Another option is to use a practice exam as a didactic learning tool. The exam instructions can contain knowledge clips, text, images and files. An example of this is an Excel test in which it is first explained how to use Excel, you can download an Excel file, perform a certain action and indicate in an entry field what a certain outcome of the action is.

The results of the formative tests are valuable for both the student and the teacher. Both gain insight into where the student stands in the learning process, but also where the gaps still exist.

### Advantages

* The student can receive direct feedback just in time, within the learning process.
* The assessment can be partly or fully automated in some cases.
* Response models can be provided with narrative feedback.
* There are no problems with difficult to read handwriting.
* Test results provide input into the learning process and provide the teacher with information about parts that have not yet been mastered.

### Disadvantages

* It takes time to create and fine-tune good assignments.

## Summative

The use of digital tests for number determination is quite a challenge from a distance. In order to guarantee the authenticity of the test, it is necessary to establish that the student's identity can be verified throughout the test.

Online proctoring offers a solution here, but the effectiveness strongly depends on the chosen application. Roughly speaking, four forms of online proctoring can be distinguished (SURF, 2020):

* Live surveillance with conferencing software ([SURF whitepaper]https://www.surf.nl/whitepaper-online-proctoring-surveilleren-op-afstand) ยง1.2)

* Live proctoring with proctoring software ([SURF whitepaper](https://www.surf.nl/whitepaper-online-proctoring-surveilleren-op-afstand) ยง1.3)

* Storage and verification afterwards with proctoring software ([SURF whitepaper](https://www.surf.nl/whitepaper-online-proctoring-surveilleren-op-afstand) ยง1.4)

* Automated review ([SURF whitepaper](https://www.surf.nl/whitepaper-online-proctoring-surveilleren-op-afstand) ยง1.4)

Depending on the importance of the test, an assessment must be made as to which form of online proctoring should be used. Find out within your own institution which facilities are available and what the policy is regarding the use of online proctoring.

### Advantages

* Can be an alternative for lack of capacity on campus.
* Gives students with a disability the opportunity to take the exam at home, where they may have better facilities.
* Puts less pressure on public transport.

### Disadvantages

* Technically challenging. If something goes wrong, it's very bothersome.
* Students can experience online proctoring as an invasion of their privacy if there is no transparent communication about how online proctoring is set up.
* Students can experience online proctoring as stress-increasing.
