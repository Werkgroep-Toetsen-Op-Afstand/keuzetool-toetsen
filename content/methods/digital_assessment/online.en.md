Digital assessment can take place either on-campus or online. However, a decision needs to be made as to whether it can also be taken at any time. Should every student take the exam at the same time, or can they take it at different times? In the case of formative assessment, there is little objection to this. However, it does have implications for summative assessment, as the questions from previous exams may have been leaked. For both location- and time-independent summative assessment, we advise making sure that the online proctoring is working properly (see, in Dutch, [Klinkenberg, 2021](https://www.onderwijskennis.nl/sites/onderwijskennis/files/media-files/Thema%205%20-%20Sharon%20Klinkenberg.pdf)).

## Formative

Examples of digital formative assessment could be a practice test for an exam that covers all of the learning objectives, or an exam that covers a limited set of learning objectives, such as an online formative exam that selects random questions from an item bank on a specific subject. Another possibility is the use of a practice test as a learning tool. Such a test could include theory in the form of short videos, text, images and other files. An example is an Excel assessment test, which first explains how to use Excel, then has the student download an Excel file, explains how to carry out a certain action, and has a field in which the student can enter the outcome of the action.
The results of formative exams are valuable both for the student and the lecturer, as they provide both with insight into the student’s progress as well as any gaps in the student’s knowledge.

### Advantages and disadvantages 

+ Student can receive direct feedback, as part of the learning process.
+ This does not depend on the lecturer, but is provided by the system.
+ Answers can be marked automatically and narrative feedback can be added.
+ The results can provide insight into the learning process, both for the students and the lecturer.
- It is time-consuming to design and fine-tune good assessments.

## Summative

There are some difficulties involved in the use of online exams to provide a grade. To ensure that the exam is the student’s own work, it is imperative that the student’s identity can be verified for the complete duration of the exam.
Online proctoring makes this possible, but its effectiveness depends very much on the selected method. Generally speaking, there are four types of online proctoring (SURF, 2020):

*Live proctoring using conference software (SURF report §1.2)
*Live proctoring using proctoring software (SURF report §1.3)
*Recording and post-monitoring using proctoring software (SURF report §1.4)
*Automated reviewing (SURF report §1.4)

Depending on how important an exam is, a decision needs to be made as to which form of online proctoring should be used. Find out which facilities are available at your educational institution and what the policy is concerning the use of online proctoring.

### Advantages and disadvantages

+ Can provide an alternative if there is a lack of capacity on-campus.
+ Gives students with a functional impairment the opportunity to take an exam at home, where they may have better facilities.
+ Reduces the pressure on public transport.
- A technical challenge: it is very annoying if something goes wrong.
- Increases the pressure on boards of examiners.
- Can be considered a breach of privacy.
