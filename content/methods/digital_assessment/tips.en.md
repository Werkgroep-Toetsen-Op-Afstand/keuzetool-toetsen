* Link your learning objectives with tags to the formative and summative digital tests and make these results transparent for students and for yourself as a teacher. See [this SURF publication](https://www.surf.nl/good-practice-feedback-op-basis-van-digitale-toetsresultaten).

* Emphasize for the formative assessment that making mistakes is allowed, but that you as a student can see where you stand in the learning process through the formative assessment. It is therefore important that students take the formative practice tests seriously and with dedication.

* For open questions, limit the answers of students, for example in the number of words or in the content of the answers, to prevent too extensive answers.

* When both knowledge and application are tested, the workload can be alleviated by using a mix of multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank questions and essay questions. Item banks or standardized answer models can also be used, whereby the assessor, for example, scans for the occurrence of certain terms.

* If you are interested, read [SURF's conversation about public values in practice with the Ethics Compass in conversation about online proctoring](https://communities.surf.nl/publieke-waarden/artikel/publieke-waarden-in-de-praktijk-met-het-ethiekkompas-in-gesprek-over).
