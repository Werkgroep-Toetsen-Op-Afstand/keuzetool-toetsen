> I have students write their own exam questions and let other students use them as practice material. Some of these questions can also be used in the exam.

*Use tags to link your learning objectives to the formative and summative online exams and report the results to the students and to yourself as lecturer. See [SURF publication, in Dutch](https://www.surf.nl/good-practice-feedback-op-basis-van-digitale-toetsresultaten).
*In the case of formative assessment, emphasise that it is permitted to make mistakes, but that the students should do their best to practice.
*Ensure compatibility between formative and summative assessment.
