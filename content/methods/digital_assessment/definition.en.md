By digital assessment, we mean assessment using a software programme that has been designed for that purpose. This can be a part of an e-learning platform such as Canvas, or a separate assessment software programme such as TestVision or Remindo.
Digital assessment makes it possible to use various types of questions, from multiple choice, to drag and drop, to short essay questions. Digital assessment is suitable for assessing the following levels of cognitive learning: remembering, understanding, applying, analysing and evaluating.
