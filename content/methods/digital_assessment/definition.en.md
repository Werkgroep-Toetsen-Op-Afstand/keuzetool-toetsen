By digital tests we mean tests that are taken in an application specially designed for this purpose. This can be a functionality of the electronic learning environment such as Canvas, or a separate test application such as TestVision or Remindo.

With a digital test you can use various question types. These range from multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop questions to short fill-in questions. Digital tests are suitable for testing the following of [Bloom](https://www.utwente.nl/.uc/f84db0b51010284fa9c0174f5f903a6aaa8aeaf3a528a00/bloom-taxonomie-checklist.pdf)'s cognitive levels: remembering, understanding, application, analysis, and evaluation. Digital exams can be used in both a formative and summative approach. In a summative approach, exams lead to decisions about students (such as passing or failing), in a formative approach, exams are used to determine where students are in their learning process, where they should work towards and how they can best do this [@of2017keys]. Instead of a digital exam, you can also opt for a physical 'pen-and-paper exam'. Although digital assessment has several advantages, including efficient assessment and analysis of tests taken and possibilities for remote testing, there are also arguments for opting for a physical test; for example, when an exam is taken on campus but there are not enough computers available or when the exam contains assignments that require drawings. It is also possible to digitally assess physical exams by scanning the answer sheets.
