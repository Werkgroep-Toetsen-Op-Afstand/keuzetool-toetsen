* Share an example of an open-book or take-home exam question with the students in advance and talk to them about what would make a good answer ([Deneen, 2020](https://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/3341944/closed-book-to-open-book-exam_final.pdf)), for example by having them share and compare good and less good answers to this question by previous batches of students.
