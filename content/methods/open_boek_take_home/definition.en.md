Open book exams and take-home exams can be used as an alternative to 'traditional' exams (whether or not taken remotely). In this context, 'traditional exams' are understood to mean: exams with open and/or closed questions where no study materials may be used as aids. Open book exams and take home exams are suitable for testing the following cognitive levels by [Bloom](https://www.utwente.nl/.uc/f84db0b51010284fa9c0174f5f903a6aaa8aeaf3a528a00/bloom-taxonomie-checklist.pdf): remembering, understanding, application, analysis, and evaluation.

## Open-book exam

An open-book exam is an exam in which students are allowed to use their own notes, summaries, textbooks and/or other materials to answer the questions. There is a time limit of a few hours and surveillance or online proctoring. While a closed book exam is suitable for testing core material, i.e. knowledge that students must remember and be able to reproduce, the open book exam is more suitable for testing whether students are able to deal with a large amount of knowledge [@heijne2011directing] . Open book exams can be used to test knowledge that students should be able to find, understand and apply at the right time, in other words: the mantle material [@heijne2011directing].

Open book exams have a number of advantages [@heijne2011directing]:

* The emphasis on cramming and reproduction is reduced.

* A larger amount of material can be covered in the same time frame.

* It encourages teachers to ask questions at cognitively higher levels.

* The test seems to be more in line with possible changes in the way in which current students process information (which are related, among other things, to their familiarity with and use of digital technology).

* The test is more in line with problem-based learning.

On the other hand, open book exams have the disadvantage that they are not suitable for testing knowledge reproduction [@heijne2011directing]. Nor is it the case that using open book exams automatically encourages students to learn in depth; for this, attention to increasing the self-confidence and motivation of students is important [@heijne2011directing].

## Take-home exam

A take-home exam can be seen as an extended version of an open-book exam. A take-home exam is an exam that students can take at a location of their own choice and without surveillance or proctoring, and for which they are given a certain number of days [@bengtsson2019take].

Take home exams have a number of advantages [@bengtsson2019take]:
* Take-home exams are well suited for testing higher-order cognitive skills.
* Due to the time limit of a few days instead of a few hours, take-home exams offer the opportunity to ask complex open questions and also enough questions to cover the learning objectives, which improves content validity.
* For students, the cognitive load and stress due to time pressure are virtually eliminated.

On the other hand, take-home exams have the disadvantage that there is a risk of fraud without surveillance or proctoring. A take-home exam is also (partly for this reason) less suitable for testing lower-order cognitive skills [@bengtsson2019take].
