## Open-book exam

### Preparation

Before you start constructing the exam questions, first draw up a test matrix/specification table to ensure that the various knowledge and skill aspects that the test aims to measure are covered and thus ensure content validity [@van2017toetsen]. For this, see for example [this guide from Hogeschool Utrecht](https://husite.nl/toetsing-nieuw/toetscyclus/constructie/het-opstellen-van-een-toetsmatrijs/).

Construct context-rich open-ended questions that test higher-order skills. Always ask students to substantiate their answer ([CELT, 2020](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/how-to-design-and-execute-an-online-open-book-exam-2.pdf)). Use case studies, contexts and examples in the questions that are not yet known to the students ([University of Twente, n.d.](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/online-examination/open-book-exam/)). Don't ask questions that require them to look up the answer only in their book ([LD&TI, undated](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/268980/LDTI-Open-Book-Exams.pdf)).

Create, preferably together with another lecturer, an assessment model that is easy to use and suitable for assessing very diverse answers ([CELT, 2020](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/how-to-design-and-execute-an-online-open-book-exam-2.pdf)).
Communicate to the students which resources they may use during the open book exam ([CELT, 2020](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/how-to-design-and-execute-an-online-open-book-exam-2.pdf)) and also explains why ([University of Twente, n.d.](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/online-examination/open-book-exam/)). Give the students some sample questions in advance so that they have an idea of what to expect ([CELT, 2020](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/how-to-design-and-execute-an-online-open-book-exam-2.pdf)). Communicate with students about how best to prepare for the open book exam. Make it clear that they should prepare it just as thoroughly as a closed-book exam, but that it is also important that they familiarize themselves with the tools they are allowed to use during the open-book exam and find out for themselves how they can use them best to organize [@heijne2011directing].

#### In case of remote testing:

Use different variants of the test, in which you vary the order of questions, with names, numbers, situations, etc. ([CELT, 2020](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/how-to-design-and-execute-an-online-open-book-exam-2.pdf)).

### During

In the case of an open book exam, extra strict supervision must be exercised to ensure that the students only use the prescribed resources.

#### In case of remote testing:

Depending on the chosen proctoring method, you as a lecturer may be virtually present in the conferencing software, watch the images live or just be on standby. At some institutions, teachers explicitly have no role in viewing the images.

### Afterwards

If the open book exam was administered remotely using proctoring, the processing of the proctoring results afterwards depends not only on the chosen proctoring method, but also on the process agreements made within the institution. So inquire about the policy and the working method.

If 'recorded proctoring' or 'automated proctoring' is used, the recordings must be analysed. Possible cases of fraud are then submitted to the examiner or board of examiners for assessment. If recorded proctoring has been used, do not record the results until no problems have emerged.

If no use is made of proctoring, but the open book exams are submitted online, a plagiarism check can be used to determine whether the products submitted are your own work.

The processing of the test results proceeds in the same way as an open book exam on campus.

### Points of attention

* Students tend to underestimate the preparation required for open book tests. Encourage them to prepare open-book exams just as thoroughly and thoroughly as a closed-book exam [@heijne2011directing].

* For the successful application of open book exams, it is crucial that there is sufficient support among teachers for the use of this type of exam and that they feel sufficiently competent to construct questions for open book exams [@heijne2011directing].

* Have students submit their work digitally so that a plagiarism check can be performed [@bengtsson2019take].

* Make a substantiated choice for the cut-off score to be used. For guidelines, see for example [Soeting and Haykens (n.d.)](https://husite.nl/toetsing-nieuw/wp-content/uploads/sites/299/2020/02/Cesuurrichting.pdf)

## Take home exam

### Preparation

Before you start constructing the exam questions, first draw up a test matrix/specification table to ensure that the various knowledge and skill aspects that the test aims to measure are covered and thus ensure content validity [@van2017toetsen]. For this, see for example [this guide from Hogeschool Utrecht](https://husite.nl/toetsing-nieuw/toetscyclus/constructie/het-opstellen-van-een-toetsmatrijs/).

Design the questions of the take home exam in such a way that a thorough understanding of the subject matter is required [@bengtsson2019take]. Make use of open-ended questions that demand an extended answer: essay questions [@bengtsson2019take]. Use contextualized questions and ask students to apply their knowledge in new, yet unknown contexts (Bengtsson, 2019; [University of Twente, n.d.](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/online-examination/open-book-exam/)). For each question, ask the students to substantiate and justify their answer, with references to sources (Bengtsson, 2019, [University of Twente, n.d.](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/online-examination/open-book-exam/)).

Clearly communicate to the students what the rules are regarding the take-home exam: may they or may not collaborate with others, what resources may be used, etc., and also explain why ([University of Twente, undated](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/online-examination/open-book-exam/)). Also communicate when and how they should hand in their take-home exam ([University of Twente, n.d.](https://www.utwente.nl/en/telt/online-lectures/remote-assessment/online-examination/open-book-exam/)). Also give the students some sample questions in advance so they know what to expect, and give an indication of the expected answer length ([Deneen, 2020](https://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/3341944/closed-book-to-open-book-exam_final.pdf)).

### During

During the time the students take the take-home exam, no special actions are required from the teacher. However, the lecturer must be available to answer any questions the students may have about the take-home exam.

### Afterwards

Perform a plagiarism check if the take-home exams are handed in online.

### Points of attention

* Take measures to prevent fraud during take-home exams.

* Use the take-home exam exclusively for testing higher-order cognitive skills [@bengtsson2019take].

* Make students aware of ethical rules of conduct when taking take-home exams.

* Prior to the take-home exam, be as transparent as possible about the assessment criteria and the desired form of the elaboration.

* Assume a realistic time investment of students; therefore do not make the assignment too extensive.

* Let students (randomly) explain their performance orally.

* Let students describe the process to the elaboration.

* Have students submit their work digitally so that a plagiarism check can be performed [@bengtsson2019take].

* Make a substantiated choice for the cut-off score to be used. For guidelines, see for example [Soeting and Haykens (n.d.)](https://husite.nl/toetsing-nieuw/wp-content/uploads/sites/299/2020/02/Cesuurrichting.pdf)
