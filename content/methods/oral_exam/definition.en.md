An oral exam is an exam in which a student answers questions orally or gives a pitch/presentation. Oral exams are suitable for assessing the following levels of cognitive learning: remembering, understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating and creating. 
 
Oral exams are often combined with other assessment methods. Often, an online oral exam takes place following submission of a portfolio, project, product or presentation. During an online oral exam, a student may also be allowed to give a short online presentation. This makes it possible to carry out both an observation of an activity and an interview in which you ask the student to explain their actions. A project or product is often combined with a presentation.
