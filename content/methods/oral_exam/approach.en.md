## Preparation

In order to ensure good content validity, it is important that each of the intended learning objectives is covered by a discussion topic ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).

The more questions asked during the oral examination, the more reliable the assessment. However, an oral interview usually does not last longer than one hour and the space for asking questions is therefore limited, especially since oral questions cannot usually be answered as to-the-point as written questions ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).

Use a specification table that indicates per subject how much time may be spent on it. Spend more time on the more important topics ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)). Another way is to use a card catalog of questions (the "top hat method"), in which the number of questions related to a certain topic depends on the importance of that topic. Students may blindly draw cards from this tray; they must answer each card drawn ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).

Provide transparency: Students are often nervous for (online) oral exams. Give the students information in advance about what to expect. Inform them in good time and completely about content, procedures, participating assessors and the method of assessment. Furthermore, give them examples of questions that could be asked ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)). By sharing a number of representative practice assignments prior to an oral test, it is clearer to the students what kind of test questions they can expect. They can use the practice exercises to evaluate whether they have mastered the study material sufficiently.

If you're converting an open-ended test to an oral one, keep the following in mind:

* Closed questions are not recommended for oral exams for large groups. The questions can quickly leak, while the administration of different questions for all students is at the expense of the already lower reliability. In addition, an oral exam offers the opportunity to ask in-depth questions.

* During an oral presentation you can also use images such as an anatomical picture, a technical drawing or a model as the basis for a question.

* Estimate the number of questions you can ask in the time available.

* Write down learning objectives, associated questions and probing questions in a (assessment) table. For example:

  |
-|-
Maximum duration | 5 minutes
Learning objective | Conceptual Statistical understanding about null hypothesis testing
Question (with cognitive level)* | Why is it necessary to determine in advance how many test subjects you need for null hypothesis testing? (to evaluate)
Answer model | To guarantee that the target alpha (1pt) and Power (1pt) can be achieved (1pt).
Points | 3

If you have an existing written test with open questions, you can also use the original assessment model (possibly with some adjustments) for the (online) oral exam.
