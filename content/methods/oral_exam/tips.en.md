* Conduct assessment interviews in groups. Students preview each other's products, ask questions and provide peer feedback. Of course, an examiner can also ask questions and provide feedback. See [this Inholland publication for more information about organizing peer feedback](https://www.inholland.nl/media/18717/inh_factsheet-peerreview_a4-nl-digitaal.pdf).
* Facilitate the practice of an assessment interview by scheduling an online meeting in which students can practice among themselves. Make sure the assessment form is available and let students give each other feedback using the assessment form. By giving peer feedback, students also learn a lot about their own performance, it stimulates their self-assessment and they gain inspiration from each other. See [this Inholland publication for more information about organizing peer feedback](https://www.inholland.nl/media/18717/inh_factsheet-peerreview_a4-nl-digitaal.pdf).
* Encourage students to create their own test questions in preparation for an online oral exam. Using online flashcards, the test questions can be shared as practice material. You can also use some of these questions in the test itself.
* To a student, an online assessment interview at the end of a thesis process or a graduation internship may seem impersonal. It does not always do justice to the effort that has been made. In these types of occasions, an on-site interview is clearly preferable to an online assessment interview.
* Possible alternatives to an online oral exam are a processing assignment or a test with open and/or closed questions.
