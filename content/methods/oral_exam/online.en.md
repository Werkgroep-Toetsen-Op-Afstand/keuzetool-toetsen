**Online assessment interview** During an online assessment interview, the examiner asks the student questions based on predetermined criteria, using video conferencing software. These could be questions about situations that show that the student has acquired certain skills and competences. The examiner may also ask follow-up questions. Often, an online assessment interview takes place following the submission of a portfolio, project/product or presentation. During an online assessment interview, the student may be allowed to give a short online presentation. 

**Online oral exam** In an online oral exam, the student answers questions orally. As examiner, you can ask follow-up questions or ask the student to clarify an idea, to check that they really understand it. You can ask the question orally and/or in writing (e.g. using the chat function). Online oral exams are often used instead of a written exam with open-ended and/or closed-ended questions.

A combination is of course also possible.

## Advantages

## Disadvantages
