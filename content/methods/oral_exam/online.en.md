## Online assessment interview

In an online assessment interview, the examiner asks questions to the student via video conferencing software based on predetermined criteria. You may be asked about situations that show that the student possesses certain competencies. The examiner can then ask further questions. An online assessment interview is often held in response to a portfolio, project/product, presentation or observation. Sometimes the online assessment interview starts with a presentation by the student.

## Online oral exam

In an online oral exam, the student answers questions orally. As an examiner, you have the option to ask for additional explanation or to have a concept clarified to determine whether the student really understands it. The questions can be presented to the students orally and/or in writing (for example via a chat function). An online oral is often used as a substitute for a test with open questions.

Naturally, combinations of the above two forms are possible.

## Advantages

* The biggest advantage of a remote oral test is that it can be done independently of location, and also time-independently in the case of a video recording. This makes observing less time-consuming for an assessor due to the lack of travel time, for example. It is also easier to organize assessment by several assessors. Research shows that the validity of observations often increases greatly by adding extra observations or assessors, something that is facilitated by remote observation.

## Disadvantages

* Chance of technical problems due to connection failure.
