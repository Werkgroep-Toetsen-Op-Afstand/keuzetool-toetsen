In an online presentation, a student gives a presentation or pitch on a certain subject, either individually or as a group, using video conferencing software. The student may also use presentation tools, drawings, plans or models during the presentation. The presentation can be given live or can be pre-recorded, and there may be time during or after the presentation for questions. Presentations are suitable for assessing the following levels of cognitive learning: remembering, understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating and creating.
