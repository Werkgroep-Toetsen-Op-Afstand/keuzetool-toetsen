* It may be practical to have the students record their presentations. For example, these can be reviewed afterwards, for example by the assessor himself in case of doubt, or by a second assessor. It can also be instructive for the student to watch the recording himself or together with the assessor, to reflect on the presentation or to discuss the assessment.

* Facilitate practicing an online presentation by scheduling an online meeting in which students can practice among themselves. Make sure the assessment form is available and let students give each other feedback using the assessment form. By giving peer feedback, students also learn a lot about their own performance, it stimulates their self-assessment and they gain inspiration from each other. See [this Inholland publication for more information about organizing peer feedback](https://www.inholland.nl/media/18717/inh_factsheet-peerreview_a4-nl-digitaal.pdf).

* Feedback can also be incorporated into the subtitles of a recorded video. This allows the student to see exactly to which behavior the feedback applies. This option is available in YouTube and in Microsoft Teams, among others.

* Students can also record their presentation/pitch in advance. This can sometimes be a godsend for students with performance anxiety. An advantage of this is that students have other opportunities to show creativity. A disadvantage is that interaction with the audience and the teacher is not possible while the video is playing. It is therefore advisable to schedule time after playing the recording to answer questions (online) and provide feedback. Another disadvantage may be that other skills (e.g. video editing) unconsciously play a role in the assessment.

* With formative tests, fellow students can also be used for the assessment.

* In addition to knowledge production, a presentation can also be used to test oral and presentation skills.

* A presentation can also serve as an overview or summary of a project, rather than a longer report, reducing grading time. Another advantage is that the possibilities for fraud are very limited. Although such assessments traditionally often take place on location, considerations regarding time, money and space (for both the program and the students) can lead to such an assessment being administered remotely.

* For a student, an online presentation at the end of a thesis process or a graduation internship may seem impersonal. It does not always do justice to the effort that has been made. On these types of occasions, a collection on location is clearly preferable to an online collection.

* See if you can contribute to a feedback culture, for example by giving some of the tests a formative instead of a summative function and by using peer feedback.
