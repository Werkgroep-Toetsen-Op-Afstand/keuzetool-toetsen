Students need different skills to give an online presentation. As well as the ability to use video conferencing software, the presentation may also need to be adapted to the online setting. A physical poster presentation really is a different activity when done online.

## Advantages

*Can be done live or can be pre-recorded.
*Location-independent.
*Can simulate a real-life professional setting.

## Disadvantages

*Limited reliability if there is just one examiner.
*Risk of technical problems.
*More difficult to assess non-verbal presentation skills.
