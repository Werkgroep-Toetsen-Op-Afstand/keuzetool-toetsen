Presenting online sometimes requires a different skill from students. In addition to being able to use the video conferencing software, in some cases the presentation itself will also have to be adjusted in order to be able to offer it digitally. A poster presentation is physically a different activity than online.

## Advantages

* The biggest advantage of a remote presentation is that it can be done independently of location, and in the case of a video recording also time-independently. This makes observing less time-consuming for an assessor due to the lack of travel time, for example. It is also easier to organize assessment by several assessors. Research shows that the validity of observations often increases greatly by adding extra observations or assessors, something that is facilitated by remote observation.

* Another advantage of a video recording is that the assessor can watch the video together with the student to reflect or substantiate an assessment.

## Disadvantages

* Chance of technical problems due to connection failure.

* Poorer assessment of non-verbal presentation skills.
