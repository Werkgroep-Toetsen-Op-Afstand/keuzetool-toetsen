## Preparation

**Assessment form** If a presentation is to be given online, you may need to make some changes to the assessment form as not every criterion can be assessed online. For example, it is difficult to judge whether the student manages to hold the audienceâ€™s attention.

**Anticipate technical problems** Organising online presentations differs somewhat from organising presentations face-to-face. As well as the 'normal' information (about planning, procedure, equipment, expectations, assessment method), you also need to communicate the ground rules for working on the online platform. For example, rules about sharing the screen, turning the camera/microphone on and off, the procedure for asking questions, and what to do in the case of any technical problems. Many students are happy to know that they can redo a presentation if there is a technical problem. You can also encourage students to practice with each other beforehand. Some institutions allow students to loan equipment or provide a physical location for the presentation. In any case, make sure to communicate any instructions/ground rules clearly and in plenty of time. 

**Recording** The reliability of the assessment can be improved by recording the presentation, as it can then be reviewed if there are any questions about the assessment. Make sure to inform the student beforehand if a recording is to be made. Note too that the processing, storage and deletion of recordings must take place in accordance with legal requirements. Find out what the rules are for this at your educational institution. 

**Multiple examiners** The reliability of the assessment can also be improved by using more than one examiner to assess an online presentation. In the case of formative assessment, other students can also take on this role. Examiners can also review the recording after the presentation.

## During   

### Just before the presentation

*Make sure that all equipment is charged.  
*Make sure that the assessment can take place in a quiet location where you will not be disturbed.   
*Test the equipment before the presentation, and use a headset where necessary. 
*Make sure that you have the required documents to hand (rubric, assessment form, etc.), either printed out or on a second screen.  
*Log into the video conference a few minutes before the presentation.  

### Start

*Reassure the student.  
*Check that the rules are clear, and repeat them if necessary. 
*Tell the student when they can expect the grade and/or feedback.  
*If necessary, explain that the presentation will be recorded. 

### Recording

*Deal with any technical problems.

### End

*If you are working with other examiners and would like to provide direct feedback, you could ask the student to leave the online session for a moment or put them in a breakout room. You can then invite the student to return to the session once you have discussed the observations with the others.

## Afterwards

Provide the student with feedback immediately after the presentation and before giving a grade, as this is when the student is most receptive to the feedback. You may decide to allow the student access to the recording afterwards.

## Points to note

*Students often find it stressful to give a presentation, and being clear about what they can expect can help. Make sure therefore to inform the students in full and in plenty of time about what is required, the procedures, the examiners taking part and the assessment method, and set out the ground rules for use of the online platform. This is particularly important for students with a learning difficulty such as autism. You could also ask the students what you can do to make giving the presentation easier for them.
