## Preparation

For the assessment of the presentation, use predetermined criteria that have been communicated to the students, for example in a rubric.

Students are often nervous for (online) presentations. Clarity about what to expect helps. Therefore, inform the students in good time and completely about content, procedures, participating assessors and the method of assessment. In case of remote assessment: make agreements about working in the online environment. This is especially important for students with a learning disability, such as autism. Ask these students what you can do to make the presentation go more smoothly.

### In case of remote assessment:

#### Assessment form

When taking online, please note that you may have to adjust the assessment form, because not all assessment criteria can be assessed remotely. For example, maintaining the attention of the public online is difficult to assess.

#### Anticipating technical issues

Organizing online presentations differs slightly from presentations on location. In addition to the 'regular' information (about planning, procedure, any requirements, expectations, assessment) you also make agreements about working in the online environment. Think of screen sharing, switching the camera and microphone on and off, the way in which questions can be asked and the procedure to be followed in the event of technical problems. Many students like the idea of knowing in advance that they can redo the presentation if technical problems occur. You can also encourage students to practice their presentation with each other beforehand. At some institutions, the student can borrow equipment or you can offer a physical location. In any case, make sure that you communicate in a timely and clear manner about the agreements.

#### Recording

By recording the presentation, if there are doubts about the assessment, the presentation can be viewed back with the student or by a second assessor. Inform the student in advance about a possible admission. The processing, storage and deletion of recordings must take place within the legal frameworks. Ask your institution what the rules are for this.

## During test-taking

### Right before the presentation

* For the sake of the reliability of the test, make sure that the conditions under which the students give the presentation are the same for all students as much as possible, so that this influences the assessment as little as possible. Provide a quiet environment where you will not be disturbed and with as few distractions as possible for the students.

* Make sure you have the required documents (rubric, assessment form, etc.) printed or on a (second) screen to hand.

* Remote: Provide charged equipment.

* Remotely: Test the equipment prior to the test, use a headset if necessary.

* Remotely: Log in to the video meeting a few minutes before the test.

### Start

* Ask the student to show an identity card or student pass if you, as the assessor, are unfamiliar with the student.

* Reassure the student.

* Check whether the rules and agreements are clear and repeat them if necessary.

* Indicate when the student can expect the assessment and/or feedback.

* If necessary, indicate that a recording is in progress.

### During the presentation

* Remote: Respond to technical issues as needed.

### At the end of the presentation

* If you work with multiple assessors and want to provide immediate feedback, you can ask the student to briefly leave the room or, in the case of remote testing, the video conference or put him/her in a breakout room. After discussing the findings, you can have the student come back.

## Afterwards

Give feedback immediately after the presentation and (well) before sharing the mark. This is when feedback is best internalized. In the case of a recording, consideration may be given to making it available to the student afterwards.

## Points of attention

* Always have the presentation assessed by two teachers to minimize the risk of assessor effects. They can be present live or review the video recording afterwards.

* Make a substantiated choice for the cut-off score to be used.
