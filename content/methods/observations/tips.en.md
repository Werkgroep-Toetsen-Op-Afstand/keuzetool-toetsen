* By providing a number of sample recordings (e.g. previously submitted recordings) with accompanying completed assessment forms to the students prior to an (online) observation, it is clearer to the student what is expected, both in terms of content and – in the case of remote testing – regarding the recording. The student can then also compare his own performance with the recording to evaluate whether the action is sufficiently mastered.

* You can also ask the students if they want to share a recorded (online) observation in which a (partially) failed action was performed. This offers starting points for both the student and fellow students to learn from mistakes.

* Facilitate the practice of the action by scheduling a physical or online meeting. Make sure the assessment form is available and let students give each other feedback using the assessment form. By giving peer feedback, students learn a lot about their own performance, it stimulates their self-assessment skills and they gain inspiration from each other. See [this Inholland publication for more information about organizing peer feedback](https://www.inholland.nl/onderzoek/publicaties/handreiking-voor-het-scripten-van-peerreview/).

* In the case of a pre-recorded observation, ask the student to indicate on which (partial) aspect they would like to receive feedback in any case. This promotes self-steering ability.

* Give feedback to the student immediately after the (online) observation and (well) before sharing the mark. This is when it is best internalized.

* Sometimes the observation forms the end of a long learning process, for example when it comes to a performance, a complex action or solving a problem. An online observation can then come across as impersonal and does not always do justice to the effort that has been made. It is good to take this into account when considering online observation or observation on location.
