## Preparation 
 
Assessment form An assessment form is usually used when observing students. Make sure to check that all the assessment criteria can be properly assessed online; do you have all the information you need for each criterion as the observer, or will the lack of some information on the screen (e.g. a client’s reaction) make it impossible to assess certain criteria? 

Number of observations and observers The main advantage of online observation is that it can take place at any time and location. This makes it less time-consuming and easier to organise, so that more observations can be carried out using more observers, increasing the validity and generalisability of the observation. In the case of formative assessment, other students can also take on the role of observer. 

### Live observation

Anticipate technical problems When carrying out an observation live, it is important to inform the students in plenty of time of the preparations they need to take to ensure that the observation can take place without any problems. You should also set ground rules for working online, such as sharing the screen, turning the camera/microphone on and off, the procedure for asking questions and what to do in the case of any technical problems. Students like to know beforehand what to do if there is a problem. You can also encourage students to practice with each other prior to the observation. Some institutions allow students to loan equipment or provide a physical location for an online observation. In any case, make sure to communicate any instructions/ground rules clearly and in plenty of time. 
Recording
Privacy regulations The processing, storage and deletion of recordings must take place in accordance with legal requirements. Find out what the rules are for this at your educational institution. 
Making a recording If a student has to make a recording, you should provide clear instructions about what is expected: what should and should not be seen on the screen, how long should the recording be, and what equipment may and may not be used? This will prevent discrepancies in the quality of the recorded material, which may affect, possibly subconsciously, the assessment of the activity. We recommend that you consider the best equipment for students to use beforehand. For example, special recording kits are available at some educational institutions, with a camera that films the student and a camera that films the subjects of the activity. 

Assessment Discuss with other examiners the rules that apply when watching the recording, to ensure that observations are assessed as uniformly as possible; this may also apply to the assessment of students on-campus. For example, is it permitted to stop or rewind a recording (which is not possible during a live observation)?

## During the observation 

Assessment Make sure that you have the required documents to hand (rubric, assessment form, etc.), either printed out or on a second screen. If you are working with other examiners and would like to provide direct feedback, you could ask the student to leave the online session for a moment or put them in a breakout room. You can then invite the student to return to the session once you have discussed the observations with the other examiners.


## After the observation 

If a recording is made of the activity, this can – together with the feedback and assessment – provide the student with a lot of useful information. You could therefore tell students to watch the recordings together, so that they can learn from each other.
