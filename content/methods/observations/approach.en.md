## Preparation

For a valid observation, it is first of all important to ensure that the tasks to be observed are representative: complete and true to nature ([van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Education-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)). 'Complete' means that the tasks are a good reflection of the assessment domain (all the different tasks that could have been offered in the assessment). 'Realistic' means that the tasks must also be representative of the intended follow-up situation, for example in professional practice (the criterion domain). However, there is a tension between completeness and fidelity: with limited time and resources, it is not possible to fully realize both. Therefore, a trade-off will always have to be made.

For a valid and reliable assessment, do not determine mastery of a competency on the basis of one or a few assessment tasks performed, but on the basis of an assessment programme.

Use an assessment model with predetermined criteria, for example in the form of a [rubric](https://husite.nl/toetsing-nieuw/toetscyclus/constructie/het-construeren-van-een-beoordelingsformulier/).

Make sure that the various knowledge, skill and attitude aspects that the test aims to measure are covered by the criteria in the assessment model, in order to guarantee content validity. If competencies are tested, formulate the criteria in such a way that these different aspects are not assessed separately, but integrated.

Apply the four-eyes principle: construct the assessment model together with colleagues.

Because the question is to what extent conclusions can be formulated about knowledge from the behavior shown, it is recommended to use an additional instrument, such as a criterion-oriented interview that is conducted before or after the observation. If this interview is conducted afterwards, the student may, for example, be asked to provide an argumentation for the task performance followed ([van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Education-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).

### In case of remote assessment:

#### Assessment form

For an observation, an [assessment form](https://husite.nl/TESTING-NEW/TEST-Cycle/construction/the-construction-of-an-assessmentform/) is usually used. Take a good look at whether all assessment criteria can also be scored validly from a distance; As an assessor, will you soon have sufficient information for all criteria or will you not be able to score certain criteria because certain information is insufficiently visible (for example, a customer's response)?

#### Live or video recording

Use live recordings if it is necessary to intervene or discuss immediately, or if the task must be done right the first time or within a certain time. Otherwise it is easier to make a video recording.

#### Anticipating technical issues

With a remote live observation, it is important to inform students in good time about the preparations they need to make to ensure that the observation runs smoothly. Also make agreements about working in the online environment. Think of screen sharing, switching the camera/microphone on and off, the way in which questions can be asked and the procedure to be followed in the event of technical problems. Students like to know in advance what will happen if technical problems arise. You can encourage students to practice with each other beforehand. At some institutions, the student can borrow equipment or you can offer a physical location for an online observation. In any case, make sure that you communicate in a timely and clear manner about the agreements.

#### Inclusion of privacy legislation

The processing, storage and deletion of recordings must take place within the legal frameworks. Ask your institution what the rules are for this.

#### Recording

If a student has to make a recording, then that student needs clear instructions about the expected recording: what should and should not be on screen, what is the length of the recording, what equipment may or must be used (don't forget the audio recording)? This prevents major differences between students in the quality of the recorded image and sound material, which can (unconsciously) influence the assessment of the action. As a teacher, it is good to think in advance about the most suitable equipment. For example, special recording kits are available at some institutions for recording lessons, with one camera facing the student and one camera facing the students.

#### Review

What rules do you agree on when viewing the recording, so that observations are as equal as possible between assessors and possibly also with assessments of students who are assessed on location. For example, are you allowed to stop or rewind a recording (something that is not possible with live observation)?

## During 

For the sake of the reliability of the test, ensure that the conditions of the observation are as equal as possible for all students, while maintaining completeness and fidelity ([van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support .sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).

If you work with multiple assessors and want to provide immediate feedback, you can ask the student to leave the room for a while. After discussing the findings, you can ask the student to come back.

### In case of remote testing:

Make sure you have the required documents (rubric, assessment form, etc.) printed or on a second screen to hand.

If you work with several assessors and want to provide immediate feedback, you can ask the student to leave the online environment for a while or temporarily put him/her in a break-out room. After discussing the findings, you can call the student back in.

## Afterwards

If there is a recording of the action, this - together with feedback and assessment - can provide a lot of information to the student. For example, instruct students to watch videos together and learn from each other.

## Points of attention

* Engage a second assessor who evaluates the observed performance independently of the first rater, especially when standards and criteria are abstract.

* Make a substantiated choice for the cut-off score to be used.

* If the purpose of the observation is (also) to assess (professional) attitude and motivation, consider a so-called unobtrusive observation, an observation in which the person to be assessed is not aware that assessment is taking place; for example, by working with a 'mystery guest', an assessor who pretends to be a regular 'customer'.

* It may be important to discuss the observation in an (assessment) conversation. As an observer, you sometimes do not know why a student makes certain choices and you can only give a good assessment if you discuss them.

* It may be important to combine the observation with other sources. For example, if you want to know whether students feel safe with a student in the classroom or whether they have understood the student's explanation, it is sometimes better to ask the students themselves, for example with a short questionnaire. Observer scores are not always related to student scores (Dobbelaer, 2019).## Points of attention
