An online observation can be carried out in three ways:

1. Watch an online activity live. This could be an activity that needs to be done online (e.g. using a computer programme) or an activity that takes place online for the purpose of assessment (e.g. conducting an interview). The observation can take place at any location.
2. Watch an activity live on-location. The observers watch an activity live at another location (e.g. a student using a machine while on an internship). The observation can take place at any location. 
3. Watch a video recording. The student records the activity (e.g. a teacher training student giving a lesson is recorded with equipment intended for the purpose).

## Advantages and disadvantages

The main advantage of online observation is that it can be done from any location, and in the case of a video recording, at any time. This is less time-consuming for the observer, for example because travel to the location is not required. Assessment by a group of observers is also easier to arrange. Research shows that the validity of observations often increases considerably with an increase in the number of observations or observers, and this is made easier using online observation. 
Another advantage of using a video recording is that the examiner can review the recording together with the student, for example to explain the reasoning for the final grade. The student can also use the video to reflect on the activity.

However, online observation may mean that the observer has less information available than if they were on-location. For example, when observing a lesson given by a teacher training student at a primary school, the observer cannot walk around the classroom, or the view may be limited if children are working in the corridor. It may also be more difficult to interpret non-verbal communication. If not enough information is available, this can affect the validity of the observation. The advantages and disadvantages must therefore be carefully considered in each situation.  

### Main advantages	

* Less time-consuming for the observer
* Easier to organise multiple observers 
* Possible to watch recording with student

### Main disadvantage

* May limit information available to observer

Combination An observation can be combined with an assessment interview to allow the student to explain why they made certain choices.
