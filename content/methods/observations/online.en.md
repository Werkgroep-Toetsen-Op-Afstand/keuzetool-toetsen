Remote observation can be carried out in three ways:

1. Watching an online action live. It can be an online action (for example, working with a digital computer program) or an action that (unlike normal) takes place online before the assessment (for example, conducting a conversation). The observation is location independent.

2. Watching an action on location live. The assessor(s) watch live from a distance (for example when using a machine at an internship). The observation is location independent.

3. View a video recording. The student records the action on video (for example, teaching during an internship is recorded with appropriate equipment).

## Advantages

* The biggest advantage of remote observation is that it can be done independent of location, and also independent of time in the case of a video recording. This makes observing less time-consuming for an assessor due to the lack of travel time, for example. It is also easier to organize assessment by several assessors. Research shows that the validity of observations often increases greatly by adding extra observations or assessors, something that is facilitated by remote observation.

* Another advantage of a video recording is that the assessor can watch the video together with the student to reflect or substantiate an assessment.

## Disadvantages

* When observing remotely, the information for the assessor may be more limited than on location. For example, when observing a lesson given by a student at his primary education internship school, the assessor does not have the opportunity to walk around the children or the view through the image may be limited if, for example, there are children on the screen out of sight. going to work. It can also be more difficult to properly interpret non-verbal communication. If the information for the assessor is too limited, the validity of the assessment may be compromised. The pros and cons must therefore be carefully weighed in each assessment context.
