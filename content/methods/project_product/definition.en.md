With projects and products, students can apply what they have learned in an active and practical manner, and within set boundaries. This improves their understanding of the subject. Projects and products are suitable for assessing whether a student can create and apply, analyse and evaluate knowledge. 

However, projects and products are less suitable for assessing whether a student has a broad knowledge base. In practice, projects and products are often combined with other types of assessment that are more suited to this, such as exams with open-ended and/or closed-ended questions. It may not always be necessary to test a studentâ€™s broad knowledge base separately, for example if it was assessed in a previous course, or if it was sufficiently addressed as part of the project/product. 

A project or product is often combined with an oral exam or presentation.
