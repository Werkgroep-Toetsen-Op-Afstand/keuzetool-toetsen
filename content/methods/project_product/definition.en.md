With projects and products, the student applies knowledge in an active, practical manner within the set frameworks. Applying knowledge leads to better processing of the teaching material. Projects and products are suitable for determining whether the student can apply, analyse, evaluate or create knowledge (see this [publication of SLO](https://www.utwente.nl/.uc/f84db0b51010284fa9c0174f5f903a6aaa8aeaf3a528a00/bloom-taxonomy-checklist.pdf) for more information on Bloom's cognitive levels).

Projects and products are less suitable for assessing whether someone has a broad knowledge base. In practice, projects and products are therefore often combined with test formats that are suitable for this, such as tests with open and/or closed questions. Sometimes it is not necessary to assess the knowledge base separately, for example because it has already been assessed in another previous course or because it is sufficiently covered in the project/product.

A project or product is often combined with a presentation or an oral test.
