With a project or product, a student carries out a clearly-defined assignment. Projects often result in a product such as an analysis, recommendation, design, final product or essay: 

***Analysis** The student analyses a situation, problem or issue, separating the main issues from the side issues and/or identifying the advantages and disadvantages. 
***Recommendation** A recommendation is often the result of an analysis. The student collates information from various sources to come up with a recommendation and a possible solution. 
***Design** A design is a description or visualisation of a future reality. 
***Final product** A final product can be physical or digital and can be put to actual use. 
***Essay** An essay is a text in which the student gives a substantiated opinion on a particular subject. The student therefore learns to think critically about a subject. Short essay questions can also be given as part of an online exam.

These products can of course be combined. For example, a research report combines analysis, an essay and a recommendation.

Students often submit their work digitally through a learning management system (LMS), which makes it easy to assess the work online. In the case of a physical product, the student can make a video recording or demonstrate it in a live stream.

## Advantages and disadvantages

+ The online assessment of projects and products does not differ very much from on-campus assessment.
- A physical final product may not come over as well in an online setting, but this depends on how well the student is able to convey the relevant details.
