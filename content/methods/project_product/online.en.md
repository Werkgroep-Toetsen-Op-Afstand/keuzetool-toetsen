For a project or product, the student carries out a well-defined assignment. Projects often have a product like an analysis, advice report, design, product or essay as a result:

* **Analysis** A student analyzes a situation, problem or issue, distinguishes between main and side issues and/or identifies advantages and disadvantages.

* **Advice report** An advice report often follows an analysis. The student integrates information from different sources to arrive at a well-founded advice report and to present a possible solution.

* **Design** A design is a description or visualization of a future reality.

* **Product** A product is a concrete physical/digital end product that the user can use functionally.

* **Essay** An essay is a text in which the student describes a well-founded opinion on a certain topic. The student learns to think critically about a specific topic. Short essay questions can also be asked within a digital test.

The above products can, of course, also be combined into one end product. For example, a research report is a combination of analysis, essay and advice.

Students often deliver work digitally in a learning management system (LMS). This makes remote assessment easy. For physical products, a home-made recording or a livestream demonstration can be used.

## Advantages

* Remote testing of projects and products is largely the same as how the assessment would take place via campus education, but more flexible (independent of location and time).

## Disadvantages

* For the assessment of physical end products, a digital assessment can sometimes provide a less accurate picture. For example, it depends on how well the student is able to visualize all relevant details.
