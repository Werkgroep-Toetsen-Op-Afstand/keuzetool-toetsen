> Well before the submission date of the last draft version of the thesis, I organize an online peer feedback session. Students give feedback on each other's product on the basis of an assessment form. I notice that it saves me time as a teacher when giving feedback. Common mistakes are noticed and corrected by the students themselves. They also get a good view of the assessment form.

* Facilitate and stimulate self-directed learning within a project. Let students set personal goals within the project and reflect on them.

* Ask the students to indicate on which (partial) aspect they would like to receive feedback in any case. This promotes self-steering ability. As an assessor you can of course also choose to provide feedback on other aspects.

* Before you provide feedback on the project or product as a supervisor, you can organize a peer feedback session. Make sure the assessment form is available and let students give each other feedback using the assessment form. By giving peer feedback, students gain more insight into the assessment criteria, students also learn a lot about their own performance, it stimulates their self-assessment ability and they gain inspiration from each other. See [this Inholland publication for more information about organizing peer feedback](https://www.inholland.nl/media/18717/inh_factsheet-peerreview_a4-nl-digitaal.pdf).

* Clients from the field can be very motivating for students. Furthermore, this also contributes to the development of cross-curricular skills that are relevant in practice.

* For more inspiration for written assignments, see [this VU information page](https://sites.google.com/vu.nl/vu-teaching-learning-tips/assessment-for-learning/variations-on-written-assignments).

* Instruct the students to hand in a self-assessment based on the assessment form with the project or product. In this way they learn to reflect on their own work. If you ask them to indicate the evidence for each assessment criterion (for example, make a reference to its place in the report), this can save you as an assessor time during the marking.

* In group projects it can happen that the students make an unequal contribution to the group process. It usually works best to have students make agreements with each other at the start about the way of working together and to come back to this regularly in the supervision. This way you can avoid problems. You can also overcome this by setting up the assignment in such a way that the students are mutually dependent on each other, but this is often difficult.

* Students can compensate for each other's weaknesses in a group assignment. This does not necessarily have to be a problem as this often happens in practice/the work field. This is something to take into account when choosing an individual or group assignment. Do all students have to demonstrate that they have achieved certain learning objectives?

* For students with a learning disability such as ADD or ADHD, it is extra important to communicate clearly about expectations and deadlines. It is advisable for this target group to work with intermediate products in order to keep the work clear.
