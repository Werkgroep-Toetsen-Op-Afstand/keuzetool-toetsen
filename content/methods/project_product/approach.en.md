The preparation for online projects and products hardly differs from the preparation for campus education. First, you make an inventory of which learning objectives must be achieved by the student. You then design an assignment that ensures that the achievement of these learning objectives can be demonstrated, for example in the form of products. You also outline the frameworks within which the project or product must be completed.

Use a [rubric](https://husite.nl/toetsing-nieuw/toetscyclus/constructie/het-construeren-van-een-beoordelingsformulier/) in which the assessment criteria are clearly set out and representative of the objectives, the intended cognitive level, and (if relevant) the individual subject areas. If it concerns a project or product with objectives from different disciplines, make a distinction between those disciplines in the assessment ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).

It is important that the frameworks, such as the assessment criteria/rubric, feedback moments and the submission date, are clearly communicated to the student in advance. It is wise to share and discuss a number of detailed example projects or products with the students, so that they have a clear picture of the standards that are used.

Some students find it difficult to start a new project and suffer from procrastination. You can help these students by setting various milestones (for example: in week 2 of the project, the introduction is finished). As a teacher, you can reinforce this even more when you reward the students if they stick to the schedule; for example by planning (peer) feedback moments as milestones.

Offer the students freedom of choice within the frameworks. For example, let them choose from a selection of topics, give them space in the form their product takes and in the sources they consult. You can also consider making the assignment a group assignment. In group assignments, students have more interaction with each other and they can carry out a project together that they could never have realized alone.

## During test-taking

Organize meetings in which you discuss with the students individually or in groups how the assignment or project is progressing. It is important to be available to the student at a number of times during the (online) supervision of a project (for example during Q&A sessions) and to actively visit the students.

Students not only learn from the teacher, but also by discussing the project or product together. As a lecturer, you can facilitate this by using peer feedback tools that students can use to give each other feedback. See [this Inholland publication for more information about organizing peer feedback](https://www.inholland.nl/media/18717/inh_factsheet-peerreview_a4-nl-digitaal.pdf).

## After

What do students do with the feedback you gave them during the final assessment? To ensure that something will actually be done with the feedback, you can consider a reflection assignment. For example, let students reflect briefly on the learning objectives or on your feedback on their project or product. You can also instruct the students in later projects or products to review the previous feedback and ask them how they will incorporate this into the new project or product.

## Points of attention

* Have the work assessed by two assessors, at least one of whom is an independent assessor (who is not involved in the supervision).
* If there is an external client involved, involve this in the assessment ([Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)).
* In writing assignments, fraud can be committed if texts are copied from students of previous years or from the internet. As a teacher, you would do well to use anti-plagiarism software. A wider diversity of projects and products makes it more difficult to use each other's work. If you use a subject list, refresh the list regularly.
* Make a substantiated choice for the cut-off score to be used.
* For projects and products involving group work, take additional measures to ensure the reliability and validity of the assessment, such as [Van Berkel et al., 2017](https://remindo-support.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2020/03/Toetsen-in-het-Hoger-Onderwijs-van-Berkel-Bax-Joosten-ten-Brinke.pdf)):
     * Decide whether to give one assessment for the whole group, whether to assess each group member individually, or whether to choose a combination of assessment of a group and an individual aspect.
     * During the process, keep an eye on whether there is any free-riding behaviour, for example by observing the input of the students during group meetings or by asking individually targeted questions during a group discussion or group presentation.
     * Consider using peer assessment (e.g. in the form of peer nominations or peer rating), in which the group members assess each other's performance, and in which it is also possible to have these assessments taken into account in the marks of the individual students.
     * If there is reasonable doubt about whether the performance or contribution of one of the group members has been sufficient, discuss this and consider having them make an additional assignment.
