## Preparation 

The preparation required for online projects and products does not differ very much from that required in ‘regular’ education. You first need to identify which learning objectives are to be achieved by the student. You then design an assignment that ensures that the students can demonstrate that they have achieved these objectives, for example in the form of products. You also set the boundaries within which the project or product must be completed. 

It is important that these boundaries, such as the assessment criteria/rubric, feedback moments and submission date, are clearly communicated to the student. It is also a good idea to discuss a few examples of completed projects or products with the students. 

Some students find it difficult to start a new project and may suffer from procrastination. You can help these students by setting milestones (e.g. the introduction must be completed by Week 2). It also helps if you reward the student for sticking to the project schedule, for example by planning feedback moments as milestones. 

Make sure that the students have a certain amount of freedom within these boundaries; for example, let them choose from a selection of subjects, the form that their product will take, or the resources that they use. You could also make the project/product a group assignment, so that they interact more with each other and perhaps achieve something that would not have been possible individually.

## During

Online supervision of projects makes it difficult for lecturers to have a good overview of the progress being made, of the product or of the students’ thought processes. In the case of a group project, you miss important information about the relationships within the group. It is therefore important to plan times when you are available for the students (e.g. Q&A sessions) and to actively keep in touch with the students. 

Students do not just learn from the lecturer, but also by discussing the project or product with each other. As the lecturer, you can encourage this by implementing peer feedback tools that the students can use to give each other feedback. See [this brochure by Inholland (in Dutch) for more information on organising peer feedback](https://www.inholland.nl/media/18717/inh_factsheet-peerreview_a4-nl-digitaal.pdf). 


## Afterwards

What do students do with the feedback that you give them in the end-of-project assessment? To make sure that your feedback has an effect, you could consider a reflective assignment. For example, have the students briefly reflect on the learning objectives or on your feedback on their project or product. In later projects or products, you could also have the students reflect on the previous feedback and ask how they plan to incorporate this into the new project or product.
