<p>Often, you not only want to test knowledge, but its application too. This can be done in online exams, for example in the form of open-ended questions. Other options are open book exams or case study exams. Although these are less susceptible to cheating in their online form than exams with multiple choice questions alone, they are more labour-intensive. They are therefore more likely to be an option if you have help, such as a student assistant.</p>
<p>This assessment method is very suitable for assessing individuals.</p>
<p>Presentations, projects or products are often suitable for assessing application skills. Although presentations and interviews often take place face-to-face, they can also be carried out online using video conferencing software such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams. This saves travel time and costs for both students and examiners.</p>
