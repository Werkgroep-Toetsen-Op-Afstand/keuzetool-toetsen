<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It may be a good idea to make video recordings. These can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on their presentation or to discuss their assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>If the examiner does not know a student, ask the student to hold up their ID card or student card to show who they are.</p></li>
</ul>
