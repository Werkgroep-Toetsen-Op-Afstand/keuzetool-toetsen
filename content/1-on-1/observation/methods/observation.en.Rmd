An observation is ideally suited for testing physical abilities. When only one, or a small number of student(s) need to be assessed, an assessor is more likely to be present on site in case these actions need to be performed at a specific location. If presence on location gives the assessor a better view of the student's performance, this is preferable. However, assessment can also take place independently of place and time, using video conferencing or a video recording. On an individual level, only one person needs to be in the picture and it is quite possible to make clear video recordings.
