<p>Some activities, such as an holding an interview or using software, may be carried out by the student at home (or at another location). Other activities, such as a theatre performance or an activity during an internship, are more difficult to assess remotely.</p>
<p>The examiner may choose to watch the activity live, in which case video conferencing or live streaming will be used. In this case, the assessment is location independent, but not time independent. To observe an activity from different angles, several cameras will need to be set up, or someone will be required on location to walk around with a camera. It may also be a good idea to record the activity live, so that it can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on the learning process or to discuss their assessment.</p>
<p>Another option is to have the student make a video recording, which can be made and watched at any time and location.</p>
