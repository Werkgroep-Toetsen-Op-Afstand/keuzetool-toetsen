<p>A studentâ€™s competence in a certain task can be assessed by observing the student while they carry out an activity. Examples could be a clinical procedure, giving a lesson, using software or performing on stage. Although such activities sometimes need be carried out at a specific location, the assessment can take place at any time and location using live conferencing or a video recording. This can be very useful if the examiner is unable to be on campus, or if this takes too much time. A recording can also make it easier for the activity to be assessed by a second examiner or used for peer feedback.</p>
<p>Remote assessment is appropriate for this scale. If the recordings are made individually, only one person needs to be in the picture and it is quite easy to make clear video recordings.</p>
