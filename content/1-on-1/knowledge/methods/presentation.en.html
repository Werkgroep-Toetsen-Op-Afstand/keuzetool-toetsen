<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice at this scale. However, the assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one anotherâ€™s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be a good idea to make video recordings. These can be reviewed later, for example if the examiner is still unsure of something, or by a second examiner. The student can also benefit from reviewing the recording, either on their own or together with an examiner, to reflect on their presentation or to discuss their assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>If the examiner does not know a student, ask the student to hold up their ID card or student card to show who they are.</p></li>
</ul>
