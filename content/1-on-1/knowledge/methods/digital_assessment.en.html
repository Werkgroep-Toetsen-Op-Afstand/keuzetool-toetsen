<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the assessment is also taken by other students (e.g.Â at a different time), present the questions in random order to prevent the sharing of answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Live proctoring is quite feasible in the case of individual assessment.</p></li>
</ul>
