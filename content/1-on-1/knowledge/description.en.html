<p>Knowledge assessments carried out in a 1-to-1 setting are mainly presentations, oral exams or resits of exams. Taking such assessments remotely can have advantages, such as not having to arrange a room for a single student and costing the student less in terms of time and travel expenses. The risk of fraud is not very high with remote assessment in a 1-to-1 setting.</p>
